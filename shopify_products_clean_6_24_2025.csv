A beautiful daily essential I love planners to write notes to myself and  to remember what I did and experienced!  It's part of my morning routine and I often look at it throughout the day to jot down ideas and thoughts. Life can be so busy - I find that if I don't write things down, weeks can go by and I can completely forget so much. The Lotus Wei planner is my absolute favorite -with great ""planner"" aspects in addition to a lot of white space for wishes, hopes and dreams. As a longtime Lotus Wei fan and member of the Flower Evolution program  it's been so helpful to have this planner with information on the flowers we are working with every month, and for me to 'real time' jot down a-has and insights. Thanks for this beautiful offering! Thank you for sharing your wonderful feedback!! M Melissa P. Focus on Me I love that the Wood Dragon planner coincides with the Flower Evolution. It’s helping me go inward and learn the effects of the flower essences in my life. It gives me space to acknowledge my growth and insights as they happen.

Beautiful Planner and Journal I enjoyed looking through this with all the beautiful flowers.  I am just starting to use it and needed something like this to get me going.  I have always hesitated on journaling because I wanted it to look and read perfectly. The only reason for 4 Stars, was there were a few places that had a small slice and a torn section in the middle of the page.  Must have been during the manufacturing phase.  I still love it and this will help me get through the ""perfectionism"".  I highly recommend this exquisite journal. Thank you so much for your thoughtful review! We’re so happy you’re enjoying the planner and that it’s helping you ease into journaling. That means a lot to us! We’re truly sorry about the damaged pages—this shouldn’t have slipped past us. We appreciate you bringing it to our attention so we can look into it and ensure this doesn’t happen again. Thanks again for your support—we’re grateful for you! C CMT Beautiful I have always wanted to do regular journaling but struggled and this has been such a help!  I bought this planner for that purpose and love it.  It is beautiful, truly exquisite.  I keep it by my bed and it feels so nourishing and joyful to touch in with myself each morning and night with this journal. I am using it to record reflections, physical patterns, track my cycle, dreams, aspirations, joy.  It is the yin counterpart to my yang calendar of scheduled events, jam packed full of commitments.   The open pages and space for me is the perfect balance and reminder to keep this balance as I navigate my busy life. So glad it’s bringing you balance and joy! S Sara Best addition to my life I have been using this planner every night since the Year of the Snake began and it has been so helpful for me to get a birds eye and bugs eye of what is going on in my life. I love the way that it looks and feels and it inspires me to go back and review the past few days and weeks and things that it makes it really easy to see my progress and the transformation in my life!

I've been using lotuswei flowers for a few years now. Three stand out as profoundly life changing. This one instantly has become the most powerful one I've taken. For a few years I've felt very heavy and leaden. This has literally made me weightless in so many ways. I've been cleaning out my house, every nook and cranny i can get my hands on! Within a week I have released countless garbage bags worth of STUFF and in the past week I've noticed that my midsection is also going down. I now feel so empowered in ways that I don't know if I ever have. I seriously needed this! 🥹💕 PLEASE, make this essence one that you keep in stock! This one cannot just be a limited time offering. PLEASE! Begging you! So amazing, Vanessa! I’ll pass your feedback along & see what we can do. Often times flowers like these end up as a part of a blend. We'd love to hear about the other two stand-outs, too! Thank you for sharing. ❤️"

I have been using Boundless Wisdom and that has helped immensely. However, on the same day this person moved away to another state I ended up having a horrible kidney stone. In Chinese Medicine the kidney is related to fear, so the timing felt very interesting. I felt called to try using Awakened Expression to help, taking it internally and also applying it topically over the kidney...the pain went down by half immediately and continued to improve with each dose. I was able to soften and trust that my body was releasing the fear and that it was safe to let go. It felt very miraculous, and reminded me how much we are supported and loved by the Earth. Thank you! Thank you so much—your words mean the world! M Michael Feeling Empowered! I absolutely LOVE this elixer! I'm so glad I clicked the link when I came to the site one day to see this new blend available. Looking at the individual flowers and the description I was sold. As a Director at work I have to lead my team and run calls every day. Sometimes I get nervous about owning my own leadership and also directing people with what to do. Worried I will sound bossy or pushy, I can sometimes get timid - something about wanting people to like me or not upsetting them. I've noticed since taking this elixer I am more focused and confident in leading my team and stepping into my role. I've realized I AM the leader, and I DO need to lead.

D D.B. Perfect for doing shadow work!! I had forgotten about the exact effects of this other than feeling more self love or magnetic.... So I actually didn't connect the dots at first when I could see and integrate lots of shadow fragments with such ease.... I could just see it clearly and without judgment, helped release some shame too and not drop down into these fears or doubt... I think these things were also mostly the reason why I was drawn to it, so it's doing it's job! Also noticed the increased attraction with people reaching out haha... and a hell of a lot of friend requests on social media (I have no idea if that was coincidence, but it stood out to me) ...so something to be possibly aware of when taking this, maybe not for times you want to be more inwards drawn. Smell is wonderful too! P Pippa C. My Favourite Fragrance This truly is heavenly. My most favourite fragrance of all. T Tanya M. Confident Assurance I love the smell! Falling in Love with Gardenias! Fragrance really boosts my self confidence and attraction to the guys doesn't hurt a bit! I feel like a mighty tigress!! A Ariel H. This is my second purchase of this bottle. It won't be the last! While I prefer the oil personally, the mist is light but enveloping-enough to linger on your skin or in a room, but not too much to overpower. T Tiffani S. Captivating! Even though I don't love the scent 100%, I do feel more love for myself and playful. In addition to using Infinite Love serum, Captivator Energy Mist are a great pair. I carry the mist with me and use just before leaving my car to give me a boost of confidence! M Monique H. Yes This mist attracts beautiful men to you like flies to honey, which was exactly what I bought it for.  Nice. L Lisa M. Divine + Sexy This is divine. Another fabulous Lotus Wei offering.

Spiritual I really think this one connects you with the spiritual. It's a misty kind of thing like floating up in the clouds. It's like a connection to the thinking in Heaven. This intrigues me so much. Thank you for sharing—your connection is truly inspiring! E E.C. Interesting! I love the Frog Orchid essence. I feel like it’s really opening my mind to notice things around me. At first I was unsure… like is this making me too sensitive but then I realized that I am very in touch with my emotions. Sometimes it does take me a while to process things. I’m loving it and continuing on my journey. I am also using the Wild Abundance drops. C C.M. Peace I love this elixir, it is one of my favourites. When taking it, I felt a felt a deep sense of peace and trust.  I felt a sense of knowing and alignment within. I felt so aligned and felt as if inspired actions or words arose from my heart with a deep and solid trust in myself.  Beautiful essence all should experience. C Carrie H. Allowing Flow I do so love how this elixir has helped me with my tensions, worries, and need to ask myself “what if?”  I had been wanting to work on trusting my own decisions, and with just a couple weeks of use, I’m finding myself much more in the moment, free, and based in a more realistic mind frame…  I don’t have to figure it all out! I can’t even if I try!  Breathe! Thank you so much! C Corley M. Clarity I’ve enjoyed this elixir.  I feel the biases and pains and wounds that have distorted or led me to close my “inner eye” or perception to all around me came up to come out and dissolve.  I felt a sense of greater clarity and inner seeing, inner knowing.  However, it was seeing and knowing in an entirely new way, without the stories and clouded emotions obscuring or distorting it.  I felt I saw, perceived and knew clearly with a sense of neutral observation free of judgment and stories. A Ariel H. I enjoyed this elixir. It was gentle but powerful. For me, it gave a sense of peace and non-attachment. L Lydia T. Love! I cannot say enough good things about all the Lotuswei products and Katie’s dedication in general. I plan to try every elixir to help PTSD and I find that they all work beautifully in their own way. Frog orchid elixir helped me look at my co dependency issues from a new perspective. O Olivia s. Frog orchid Wow. This has been amazing. Within a day I started to see old patterns come up and then I had an opportunity to look at them with an open heart. Each day since I have been on a beautiful journey of letting go and accepting. It has been challenging but also so joyful at the same time. I knew it was time for me to see the old patterns and start letting them go. Even before I received the frog orchid I started to feel the effects. It happens just by looking at it the flower. I love lotus wei so much and am so greatful to Katie and her team. W Wendy D. Elevation The first use, I felt a slight physical hum to my body, a very low level vibrating, that I could not ascribe to anything else. I am highly strung and especially at my job, I'm going fast all day. I have been trying to incorporate slowing down, breathing and meditation in my life for years now but haven't made the time. This elixir has been the first thing that has induced me to stop and get out of my head. Everything is softer. I see more beauty, feel less pressure and trust that the outcome of situations will be okay no matter how they unfold. It's been the most enjoyable and appreciative three weeks I've had in ages and inspires me to continue to looking at the world this way. Thank you for the gift of your flower magic."

I have a little essential oil necklace I wear that I keep it in so I always have access to it and apply it several times throughout the day. The smell is fresh with a hint of citrus. I have found it so incredibly helpful in terms of releasing old patterns and in those moments where I question my ability to get a job done or reach a goal. The moment I find myself in that unhelpful headspace I immediately grab this oil and apply it to my neck and pulse points and wooosh, almost immediately the “can’t” attitude subsides and I feel able to tackle whatever I set my mind to. I truly love this oil and am so thankful to have found it. I highly recommend it. V V.F. Exuberance Just like the dictionary description- being full of energy, excitement, and cheerfulness;.... This set gave me a renewed sense of joy and excitement in my personal goals. The interesting thing is there was also this sense of grace and groundedness along with a maintained energy + refreshed optimism. Beautiful set for anyone feel stuck and everything that goes along with feeling stuck. L L.C. Growth in Leaps and Bounds Since I've been using this oil this past month or so, I've grown tremendously in my spiritual gifts and abilities. I've seen lots of growth in my business success as well. Thank you! C Coleen C. So grateful The Full Bloom oil is amazing - probably one of my favorites! It smells amazing. It soothes and energizes simultaneously. Love it! S S Y. Love it The mint in this one is so good. This is similar to Inspired Action in that it propels me to take realistic action and make quick progress towards the goals I have been putting off or been unsure about. I appreciate now how the steps I am taking towards achieving my goals seem to draw on a greater awareness of my own strengths and the ability to overcome my limitations, rather than a need to keep making things difficult for myself. Agree with Samantha that using it on the TCM acupressure point enhances the experience. S Samantha M. Smells so good! I adore spearmint and I'm in love with this blend. I put it on the recommended TCM point (SAN JIAO 5 - WAI GUAN: OUTER GATE) every morning and it just brightens my day. It smells so good and the mintiness makes me happy. Lovely oil. G Gina H. Smell is divine! I agree with the other reviews here about the smell...it is divine and I can't stop smelling my wrists when I have it on!  It literally puts a smile on my face every time I use it.  What a perfect way to smell and feel beautiful, naturally :) E Eveline A. Smell Divine! I was first attracted to this blend because of its smell! I found myself using up the Aura Mists too quickly and decided to get this in Anointing Oil. The smell is part sweet, part tangy, part spicy. It has an uplifting quality to it that I keep the bottle at work. It's my pick me up and wake me up routine at work, before I start my work day checking emails, etc... Whenever I put this on, I can feel my heart lifts up and open up that little bit more. :) S Sophie B. Love it! This scent is just...perfection. Uplifting and calming at the same time. It's hard not to just stand around smelling my wrists when I wear it :) I am sooo happy that there is now a full line of products. Saving up so I can get more, and continue blossoming with this amazing gift of a product. C Christie Z. Makes me smile! I am a big believer in aromatherapy. Smells, like music can transform my mood in seconds. The Full Bloom Anointing oil is one of those things that make my day, my mood better the second I put it on. It smells delicious! Every time I open the bottle,  the scent uplifts my mood no matter what is going on and makes me smile. I absolutely love Lotus Wei products. They feel so pure and genuine - connects me to that deeper place inside me that knows joy, love and happiness. Also, I would also like to add that their customer service it top notch. It seems like I just order the product and it's there shortly thereafter. Thank you so much for sharing your gifts with the world! We are so delighted to hear that you are living your best life in FULL BLOOM! :) 1 2"

I'm In Love Opening my package upon arrival was like opening my door to a new friend! Reading Katie's words was more like we were sitting together over tea and having a conversation. EVERY page emanated beauty and intelligence and I especially loved (let me see if I can get this right) learning that there are studies showing how flowers respond to us. Not just our spoken words but to our intention as well. Sometimes around holiday time, family struggles can put us into a funk and poring over every lovingly placed image helped keep me from sinking too deep into the 'muck'. I was hard pressed to put it down and finished in three days! Reading again before January comes to an end is definitely happening. Thanks so much Katie, Taylor, and Louie for such an offering of love! We truly appreciate you! Thank you for your beautiful words!! L Lyndsey S. This is THE flower essence bible! This book is hands down the most informative book I have ever read on the power and benefits we can harness from flowers. It is Katie's life work all in a beautifully written and colourful book. Get it, dive deep and show it to your friends/family! It is what we all know deep down but forgot all about! L Libby B. Invaluable Resource! I purchased this book about a month ago and I can’t even begin to tell you how often I find myself referencing it. I work as and intuitive animal communicator and Shamaness. When I work with my clients I often see flowers in their energy field; the type & color always vary based on the person. This book has helped me gain further insight into the energy I’m tracking when I see those flowers. And it is a reference I now share with my clients And advise them to read if they are interested in exploring more about their specific connection to the flower and elemental world. In addition to being informative I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the fact that the flower reads are spot on! Sometimes I will just randomly open to a page when I need some insight into what I’m feeling and without fail the lessons shared by the flower I see are exactly what I needed at that moment. I truly can’t say enough good things about this book. It’s not only beautiful but the information it holds is invaluable. Hands down one of the best books I’ve invested in, in a long time. Thank you!!! p pamela b. TRANSFORMATION! My bible for self-transformation. They say the answers are within. Yes, that is true. However, this book and Lotuswei elixirs open you up to receive the answers. Just profound and written with such love. Thank you, Katie, you are truly an earth keeper. R Ratnamala M. Profound gift of Wisdom and Inspiration! Thanks for wonderful Flower Evolution.!! While I was looking for some other books in Library from my list of wanted books, I stumbled upon 'Flower Evolution'. I am flower lover. When I looked at it, It pleased my eyes and I felt it touched my soul. With the feeling of sheer joy, I immediately got it home and started reading it. I guess there are no accidents. If something is meant for you, it will come you and I am glad I found this book!! :) Katie has done such a fantastic job. Book is very organized, full of information with stunning flower photos and ways, importance to connect with nature . It is wisely divided into 2 sections targeting different readers which makes it more interesting and enganing. What make this book unique is simple yet powerful flower rituals which anyone can do at home and can be benefited. Flower Evolution is a profound gift of wisdom and inspiration!  I am spreading word about it and trans-formative power of flowers to my friends. I see the Movement, ripple effect happening which Katie started and I am grateful to be part of it! :) Yayy!!! M Maria F. Breathtaking Clarity My first purchase of anything Lotus Wei was this amazing book and the Inspired Action elixir. Since using the elixir for about 2 weeks now, I have experienced nothing but clarity of the mind and my confidence has skyrocketed! Not only is the book packed with stunning, crisp images of  beautiful flowers, it is filled with inspiring words, stories and recipes that really speak to the soul. I am beyond excited to co tinge my journey with both the book and more Lotus Wei products. I thank the Universe it exists. G Grace B. Go Flower Power! The book is beautiful, filled with so much beautiful knowledge as well. The World needs Flower Power today more than ever. For 30 plus years I have used Bach Remedies, which are very good. As a practitioner of several Ancient Healing Practices. I'm excited to start taking the Elixirs for myself. As a Semi Retired, I would be excited to learn to be a Practitioner of Flower Power. I do have physical travel limitations now but the brain is up and running and ready to learn. Love and Light, Rev. Grace Bonnell, Port Orford, OR L Lee-Ann Magical! Flower evolution beautifully unveils the benefits of flowers. Through in depth features on specific flowers and their effects on the lives of people who've used them, the book makes it clear that they are our allies in nature. It's an invitation into a softer, calmer way of living. Magical, enchanting read, with gorgeous photographs! Beautiful description, thank you so much for sharing your experience of the book!"

I picked up this blend at the SAN center and as soon I put it on I immediately had a release. I started crying. I had bottled up expressing myself from past relationship experiences and sexual trauma as a child. There was a part of me who was holding back receiving affection or giving affection and in judgement about it and Intuitively knew this blend would support me in feeling safe to express those parts of me. After using it with Squash blossom I have seen a huge difference in feeling safe in my body and honoring my sexual and sensual nature. The smell is intoxicating. I find it lasts longer than the other anointing oils and a little goes a long way. If you feel drawn to this blend, trust yourself and say ""Yes."" 1 2"

Such And Uplifting, Positive Deck These cards are absolutely beautiful and I felt called to them the same day I discovered Lotuswei (via Kat Fowler's amazing podcast ""The Soul Awakening Podcast"")! I have felt a connection to flowers specifically for the last 6 years or so, so this was just perfect. My only (small) complaint is I wish the box top had a thumb cut-out area like others decks of oracle cards I own have, as it makes it opening it up easier. S Sydnee T. Crisp, firm and pretty This is the second deck I’m buying as a gift . They are just so pretty and brighten my day. My client has chronic pain and I think these cards will brighten her days. J Jessica B. Potent I love receiving guidance,  messages and inspiration from this deck. Increases my relationship to the natural world. Amen! M Magdalena F. intuitive messages As someone with a very active subconscious, these cards have been a dream come true. We are all intuitive, but sometimes have a hard time finding the clear understanding we need. I have found that tarot cards have provided me with exceptional guidance in navigating these confusing moments of daily life. They allow you to check-in with yourself and show you how you are truly doing. I immediately purchased these cards when I saw them. In addition to being beautiful to look at (which definitely provokes a positive physiological response!) the flowers provide answers, instructions, and guidance to our innermost questions. Even better is that one can go out and see these in real life in nature, extending the relationship and deepening our connection with both ourselves and the natural world, which are intrinsically connected. I would highly recommend these cards to anybody who needs to find peace, they are beautiful and are really magical. S Swati P. guides you to what you need The card deck has been spot-on when it comes to guiding you to what is needed in the moment. My seven year old daughter loves the Flowerevolution card deck as well. She loves to look at the pictures of flowers and sort them by colors. She has already memorized most of the flower names. C Cassandra Beautiful deck! :) Was drawn to the flower deck and I decided to get it because of the beautiful images and design of the deck! Have since received it, and they are just as beautiful in real life :) I did however find an issue with the printing of the deck. Was initially hesitant to bring it up but did anyway and LW was very open and helpful about it. I find these cards unique as it combines several different aspects into one card based on a specific flower and allows one to better understand both the flower and what it means for you. I resonate with this flower deck so much and cannot wait to learn more about each flower in depth; thank you for your creation <3 H Hannah J. Great gift for mystical lovers My friend loves to do readings for fun so I bought her this for something a little different and she absolutely loves them. C Carla S. Lovely!! I'm loving using the cards and feel I can learn so much from using them. I have the Flowerevolution Book too and I think using them together is an added bonus. Both the cards and the book are just lovely!! I highly recommend them both!! k karen t. I bought a box of  9"" x 12"" self adhesive laminating sheets and put 4 cards on each sheet. (Then cut the cards our individually.)   Used the laminating sheet front and back on the cards.  This made the cards pretty, easier to use, and it cost me $30 for a box of 50 Avery transparent sticky sheets.  The cards themselves, while reading the content, makes me more aware of my surroundings, finding the ultimate joy listening daily to the variety of birds surrounding my home gardens.   My backyard bird house has baby birds chirping inside, and my two cats have a keen eye of mama bird, going in and out of the birdhouse.  The cards make me now talk to my Lialic tree, take time smelling the blossoms of my young small, apple tree blossoms, so vey sweet and fragrant, then my two lemon trees are blooming and the scent is so uplifting and healing.  I now feel for the first time ever, the essence of every one of my of garden flowers in a deeper depth and meaning with hightened, added perception of what my shift is into awareness of flowing moments.  Nudges from the cards give us the sensation of nature blessings, natures healings, inner and outer transformations, and elemental pathways into physic possibilities and limitless expressions to unfold and hold on to. The cards are our teachers and we the student, each one of us that has this special deck will want to buy seversl decks for friends and family and work associates, and vendors and art and craft fairs every plant store and flower shop should carry these cards, also at airports where people have time to spend reading and comprehending higher forces of the divine are upon us, thank you Katie for gifting to us, these mystic and mindful work of pure genius.

Beautiful I really enjoyed this elixir. It has a tranquil feel to it for me and helped dissolve areas of resistance C C.J. Glowing and softening This is such a beautiful essence and exactly what I needed. I usually don't take much time for self-care or schedule it and then do something more important instead. After two weeks I felt a shift towards being more attentive to myself and my needs and actually following through with resting, going to bed early, taking a bath when my body felt cold and rigid. I also felt a general softening in my being and being better at letting things go. C C.P. Essence I feel like this elixir returns us to our original essence, our seed where everything is contained and nothing else needed. It is not the luscious flowering of the peony elixir but more like a gentle little fresh spring flower- humble and unadorned and beautiful- needing nothing, containing everything. It helps me remember who I truly am without any embellishment. B Brenda S. Blissful contentment Such a lovely elixir that gave a feeling of such contentment. I went to a regular acupuncture appointment and when asked what I needed worked on, I could not think of anything needing repair or fixing. I felt like everything was as it should be. That I truly desired nothing. As I acknowledged this, I thought wow! What an amazing elixir. It helps me to just be. Be content and not want for anything. What power there is in that! So I told my acupuncturist to do work on whatever it was she felt I needed, based on my pulse, energy, and the intuition she had on it. I went home afterwards and thought deeply on this profound feeling of contentment. It was wonderful. During these pandemic times, we want for so much to be different than it is, and how magical to feel contentment in this time. I reordered more when I finished the first bottle. Definitely one of my new favorites. A Ariel H. Thai was one of my first purchases with Lotus Wei and one that I've been meaning to come back to. Gentle but strong, it really helped in the self-love department. S Stephanie H. Light and Carefree While taking this elixir I felt more gentle with others, the world, myself. I was able to take deep breaths before reacting and was in an overall good mood most of the time. Things just felt light and carefree. I'm okay with where I am in my journey and felt the pressure of ""do more, be more"" dissolve. I was able to rest and felt radiant within myself. d diana a. Rejuvenating elixir I noticed a big shift in my confidence and the ""bluntness"" of my speech. I can take a deep breath breath before saying something or jumping to conclusions.  I also feel more rejuvenated, as if I turned back the clock 5 years back, and my skin is glowing! I truly feel more youthful, happy, and content with the way I am interacting with others and the way I look. I haven;t felt like that in many, many months. I also recommend Peony to bring forth your inner beauty. I will be reorder more soon. Thanks, Diana A. M Margaret W. Softening & Finding Safety With taking this elixir I found a real softening toward myself. And with being able to soften in my relationship with myself it also created a new sense of safety with myself. And from that safety and softening I was able to really look at some of my rough edges, or things I was too ""ashamed"" of to truly own before. That whole process led me to feeling so much more whole! I definitely recommend for anyone looking to soften towards themselves!! K Katherine W. Softening One of the most remarkable changes I've noticed about myself since using this elixir, is my own softening. I don't yell at my children now. I don't curse in traffic jams. And I'm not really worried about being 10lbs up or down in my weight. I feel like I'm just more accepting of myself, others, and life situations. Thank you Lotus Wei, you are supporting us to truly change our ways. Oceans of gratitude, Kate J Julie S. Soothing ritual Lotuswei flower elixirs have become a very soothing ritual in my stressful day.  I don't follow the directions perfectly, but whenever I need them I take five drops on my tongue.  I have found that they have a positive effect on my mindset. 1 2"

Icelandic Moss Elixir,Icelandic Moss Elixir,"Description Use Ingredients Delicious honey elixir infused with flower essences. 5 drops, 5 times a day, under the tongue. We were traveling through a desolate, uninhabited area in central Iceland known for sighting old female trolls, when a fluorescent green patch of ﻿Icelandic Fountain Moss ﻿﻿ appeared out of nowhere. It was like a soft cushion for the snow melt stream from the melting glaciers nearby, holding the pure mountain water in the cells of the moss. Icelandic Moss magnifies our sense of wonder, curiosity, play and discovery. It dissolves crankiness, sadness and loneliness and awakens our sense of wild freedom. MAGNIFIES: Curiosity, play + freedom DISSOLVES: Loneliness, sadness + crankiness USE: Enjoy 5 drops sublingually 5 times each day regularly until bottle is finished; or put a dropperful in your water bottle each morning and drink throughout the day.

Powerful! I felt such interest when I saw this one. It hit home - I was surprised by my reaction and HAD to get it. That plant growing all by itself - that is ME! And then what happened???? I had been taking the others and kind of felt something but this one! OMG. It really did a number on me and I changed and became a believer. And then the other ones had more impact. It makes you feel like a little ole alone entity doing it's best anyway and it's so beautiful. I say, find your flower and you will be IN - in the flower garden of life!! Truthfully I really think there is a specific flower for everyone and you just have to find it. This one makes you feel fresh and pure and vibrant! Lisa we are thrilled to hear that you found YOUR flower, and that it made you feel so fresh & vibrant! What a gift :) L L.M.P. I found the ME This was so exciting for me. I have been doing some of the elixirs and didn't feel much. But I still believed. So when I saw this one I perked up inside. I felt it. I identified with this one. Having a lonely childhood and making it on my own. I grabbed on to this. I felt so attracted and then I took it and LO and BEHOLD - it worked! I felt it, all they said and after that the next one was more and I could relate more to all them. You need to find your ONE I think. Then you really become a believer. Wow, yes yes! Finding 'the one' is super powerful. All flower essences will support us ~ but when we discover one that we have that relationship with (like you did with the Moss), it's an indicator that you're ready for those innate qualities to awaken within you! So happy you found it! T Timm perfect R Robyn R. Icelandic moss elixir I am using icelandic moss elixir, I chose it because I tend toward working hard and taking life very seriously especially around my inner process. Life has been delivering me and I have been more able to notice and receive opportunities and lessons in lightening up and play and fun. I was jumping on my mattress like a child on a trampoline… a friend said something funny and I laughed so hard all the way down into my belly and it felt so so good, I do not laugh often enough. This elixir is wonderful. It is reviving my childlike sense of discovery and openness and wonder and humility toward life experience. I have faced a lot of struggles and challenges and pain all my life. It is a breath of fresh air and a miracle for me. R R.B. Sadness relief This elixir brought up a lot of sadness deep inside. Like it brought it from deep within squeezing it from within me. It felt good to release . this is a very important elixir for dealing with sadness, highly recommend. R Rebekah O. This is a precious essence to me I became aware in the last couple years of  how deeply I was needing to reclaim my sense of innocence again. I have experienced a lot of pain and loss and have found it incredibly difficult to tap into lightheartedness and play. This essence has lifted me: A subtle, gentle, soft foundation for me to fall back on. A sigh of fresh air and relief when i use it. I have found a gradual lightening of mood and outlook over the last 2 months using it and plan to continue for a good while yet. S Sage L. A wonderful ally for parents of small children! I was drawn to this plant during a period in which I was really struggling with a sense of drudgery, overwhelm and exhaustion, particularly relative to my youngest child, a ""velcro baby"" who cries if not glued to me and who at 11 months still wakes up to nurse every 3 hours. The chronic sleep deprivation and constant overstimulation of holding him 24/7, coupled with the demands of work and parenting my other 3 children were wearing on me and I would find myself occasionally feeling resentful, which I hated! Taking this lovely elixir began to infuse the time I spent with him (and my other children) with a sense of wonder, magic, and pleasure. It helped me realign with the enchanting consciousness of early childhood; when time stands still, the smallest things hold worlds of curiosity, and the seemingly mundane is sprinkled with faery dust. (In fact I think this is a perfect elixir for anyone wanting to connect with the devic/ faerie realm!) I found Icelandic Moss to have a grounding energy as well (perhaps due to the fact that it grows right on top of rocks and earth, unlike most flowers and trees, which shoot up towards the sky), that helped me inhabit my body and each moment with greater ease. I am so grateful to this elixir for helping to bring healing to my relationship with my baby and for reminding me that even in the trenches of poopy diapers, vomit, arguments, and ouchies, the time I spend with my children is unspeakably precious and special!"

I really, really like the results I have had with this product. It has been especially helpful in finding my voice in my social media work. Thanks so much! M Mama Suprise for me I wasn't sure why I was attracted to this elixir: I'm already a  loud and fearless truth-teller. Grevillea's surprise for me was how it caused me to become externally quiet, and hear what I really had to say to myself. In my Aries-style daily quest for action and a desire to provide leadership to others, I learned that I had become quite good at ignoring my personal inner voice. I knew things but wasn't listening to me! What a change to pull back from a lifetime of endless networking/interfacing/integrating other's thoughts to hearing myself speak up inside me!"

I love the scent Every morning when I get out of the shower I already look forward to get on my meditation mat and put this sacred oil on me for the first time of the day. The scent is marvelous and they evoke a feeling of safety and space inside me. I'm very happy to have found them. Such a beautiful daily ritual, Kea-Sophie! Super happy you're here! :) N N.C. Healing crisis Infinite Love has a fragrance so delicious! About two days into applying the anointing oil however, the feelings I thought it would be shaking loose seemed to amplify, just continually reaching to keep me in their grip. Enough so that I stopped using and reached out to y'all to ask, ""Am I imagining this...?"" Your response, Lotuswei, was so supportive and identified this struggle as a healing crisis. You shared more, telling me that if I could breathe through the trepidation and darkness with the knowing that these feelings are very temporary, I would come out on the other side firmer in my conviction and truth. There were more beautiful encouragements, even now thinking of the assurance brings joyful weepiness to my eyes. Infinite Love anointing oil has had by far the biggest impact on my healing and forward momentum. Ever grateful for this healing modality you've brought into fruition. Much love, Natalie. P.S. I also have the True Strength mist which I had not opened yet. Still having trepidation when I resumed with the Infinite Love, I applied them simultaneously. This was a bit intuitive on my part, in the hope that the mist would help support me through any recurring shadows. It's been a huge help. The gifts God has given us for our benefit are perfectly demonstrated in all you offer us. May blessings abound for you all <3 j joey Love these products so much. Smells so good J J.H. Heart-liberating perfume I love this so much I keep two bottles on hand--one at my tea station, so I can remember to anoint myself first thing in the morning, and one in my purpose. The scent is heavenly--bright rosy orange--and the act of choosing to lavish myself with flowers throughout the day is a continual demonstration of self love. I've shared it with others, men and women, and seen their faces lighten and soften instantly. Applying this oil is a frequency attunement to sweetness and open-hearted joy. Thank you so much! So wonderful you keep it in those special places :) Xoxo S S. Amazing The smell of Infinite Love is intoxicating. It's fresh, it's vibrant. It softens. I love it.

I’ve used a lot of the elixirs and this one feels like a foundational one for me. In the first couple days of using it, I notice a bubbling up of thoughts and emotions that aren’t so pleasant giving me an opportunity to heal them. After about two weeks of abuse, I start to settle in to a more loving and kind view of myself. Specifically around time I spend looking in the mirror and eliminating critical self judgment. It gives me this attitude of “hey I’m OK and I like her.” Highly recommend! N Nicole Still Unsure I've tried a few different brands of flower essences and I always tend to go back to Bach. Don't get me wrong... I love the idea/intention of these, but I think they're a bit harsh on my system. In the first week, I had an intense memory around childhood trauma that I wasn't expecting, but that did allow for deep healing. In the second week, I experienced deep anxiety. It's now week 3 and I've decided to back off on taking it. I understand that sometimes there needs to be a purge or clearing with taking flower essences, but sometimes it would be nice to just feel better without having to go through a big crisis first, so ultimately, I'm on the fence about this. I've had better luck with the oil, but not necessarily for healing purposes. Just more of a nice massage oil. Thank you so much for sharing your experience and for your honesty. It means a lot to hear how the remedies are landing for you. Just a sweet reminder to take things at your own pace. I know you already know this, but the botanical intelligence in the flower remedies works in harmony with your system—bringing to light only what you're truly ready to face. That said, it’s completely okay to scale back to just 1–2 times per day. These kinds of healing experiences, while sometimes intense, are temporary, and the discomfort doesn't last. Getting on a regular and consistent rhythm with the remedies can offer powerful, long-term support. And like you mentioned, using the oil or mist as a more luxurious or occasional practice is a beautiful way to ease into the experience. Trust your timing and intuition—there’s no “right” way to do it. We’re so grateful you're giving them a try and sending lots of support as things unfold. <3 C Cidnee R. All the LOVE This was my second Flower Essence and I loved it just as much! I experienced so much LOVE from family, friends and lovers! People expressed their feelings for me and how much I have helped them in ways I have never heard before and I am sure this elixir facilitated all the love. Also!  had my first ever Valebtine's date + flowers during this time ❣️❤️✨ Love this! Your heart’s openness is truly magnetic!! L Lisa M.P. Nice Feeling It was definitely a light feeling of being more there in a bit more open way. It was surprising really like a different hidden me. Thank you for your feedback on our Infinite Love Elixir! We are thrilled to hear that it brought about a refreshing and open feeling for you. We hope it continues to bring out the wonderful version of yourself. Wishing you infinite love and happiness :) xoxo P Patricia L. Incredible and Nurturing Support Lotuswei as a company originally was a ping given to me by my dog's vet, Dr. Tan on 32nd st! I didn't buy at that appointment until flower essences came up again in another conversation that week. It took some intense emotion one night to encourage me to hear the support more intently. I took the online flower quiz and was given Infinite Love and ordered it along with the Boundless Wisdom spray. I used both ritually for what feels like ~half a month and the impact has been incredibly felt. I feel like these beautiful rituals helped me keep seeing myself in the light that I was cultivating at this time. Now, I am not taking this elixir as much; I used all of the Boundless Wisdom spray; And, picked up the Sacred Awareness Spray when we recently visited my dog's vet again! Come full circle. The whole family loves it. I have my 3 year old, dog, and husband all taking it when they feel called. My three year old LOVES hers now too (Joy Juice, but she also asks for Infinite Love as well). Thank you Lotuswei! We are forever supporters from here on out. Can't wait to interact more with your collection. M Mary M. Infinite love I do not think it was by chance I received this flower elixir before Thanksgiving. I felt so much gratitude, my heart felt full despite everything not being exactly perfect in my life.  Thankful to have been part of the beautiful power of flowers. 🌸 J J.G. Daily Heart Medicine Infinite Love is a daily requirement for my mental wellbeing these days. When I first jumped into flower essences I didn't understand what the ""stabilize"" tier meant so I skipped Infinite Love and jumped right into Open Heart as well as several other blends and It was a lot for my system... Since learning about the stabilization tier,  I always keep infinite love on hand in some form. I use it to stabilize the effects of the other elixers as well as to process life from a heart-centered and curious place. The elixer and oil are my favorite, the elixer helps me subtly drop into my heart, the oil when rubbed over my chest space gives me a feeling of physical release on the armor of old hurts. Infinite love is one my favorite mists to share with others (the other being fierce compassion) and it brings a delicious appreciation to the moment. Currently, I'm using Sacred Heart to work through old griefs and traumas, and True Strength fears around my ability to lead and navigate myself. Infinite love is the most wonderful stabilizer while working through the processing of old wounds and remaining emotionally stable Infinite Love is a balm on the heart for those who want to feel more loved Much gratitude to the team for these wonderful medicines Hey Justina! Super grateful you took the time to write your experience of Infinite Love! Yes the Stabilization blends are very much what they say...stabilizing. For the system. And we love that you pair it with other elixirs you are working with to keep that baseline stability/heart center where needed. Thank you once again for sharing! xoxo Z Z.M. Just a few days after taking the infinite love elixir I noticed a difference in myself. All I wanted to do was take care of myself whether treat myself to things I liked or looking after my health.  It definitely helped with self love and putting myself first. I’ve been doing what I like and don’t feel shame or feel bad for investing in myself. J J.J. Like Medicine For Jealousy <3 I've struggled with really challenging fears of abandonment and jealousy in relationships for years. Infinite Love is AMAZING at softening them. Today my mind wanted to go to its usual unhelpful place where it imagines a worst-case scenario of me being left or deceived. I used the Infinite Love elixir paired with the mist consistently all day. Gradually I started to think, ""Well why would THAT happen?"" every time a fear popped up. MIRACULOUS. I can feel Infinite Love helping to turn thoughts of being abandoned into curious and unlikely ideas rather than things I used to feel were inevitable. Incredible flower magic. Thank you so much! S S.L. Life changing I have been working to cultivate more compassion and love for my own humaness. This elixir has add a sense of ease and awareness. Since beginning to take Infinite Love I am constantly aware of the ways I have been abandoning myself. Like someone took the blinders off! So grateful! 1 2 3"

Self-love and kindness :) I always come back to this one whenever I need a little extra self love <3 So lovely to hear and such an important reminder! A Angela B. Incredible My infinite love spray is like a little moment for me to check in with myself and be mindful. My LMT recommended it to me for my pregnancy and labor and so far it’s been the most incredible opportunity for self care. Even in the middle of my day, it gives me a reason to stop and enjoy something. Thank you so much for your kind words about our Infinite Love Mist! We are so happy to hear that it has become a special part of your self-care routine during both pregnancy & labor. We're glad to know it's helping you take a moment to pause and be mindful. Wishing you all the best on your journey :) xoxo J Jiuan H. A cocoon of roses, a bouquet of love I'm a homeopath, and I offer Infinite Love right in my office when a client becomes emotional while telling their story. It has the magical ability to soothe, to support, and to transport them to a different state. They feel their emotions, but are not stuck in them. This is invaluable, as we can continue working in depth. Some clients love this flower essence so much that they walk out of the office with the bottle! Recently, as I offer this flower essence to moms, they report that it is just the thing that they need, whatever their specific state. It supports them to go through the day feeling nurtured, empowered and loved. It enables them to support their families. It's like walking in a field of roses. It enables us to tap into the resonance of love. Who doesn't need that? So grateful for Lotus Wei's magic! Hey Jiuan! Incredibly grateful for your beautiful feedback -  especially love that part about Infinite Love being 'a bouquet of love' :) Happy it is helping your clients! xoxo C Cynthia Spraying Joy in the morning is my connection with Jesus T Tais I didn’t feel any difference and following the instructions it only lasted a few days. J J.H. Heart awakening ritual I keep one bottle on my dresser and the smaller version in my purse. There is something so refreshing about misting oneself with intention--it seems to instantly infuse my aura with gently expansive heart energy. It is an instant energy boost and reset. I would imagine this is probably one of the most popular products here, as it is so delightful to use. I mist myself at transitional times, such as before exiting my car, to boost my energy field and center myself in loving energy. This product is subtle and potent, and a delight to use. A Alice G.R. Self love in a bottle! I am amazed at the support I am receiving! I feel held in the most tender, gentle, graceful and loving way. The critical, hard piece that I have battled with since I was thirteen is melting away! I am openly expressing love to myself and those around me without feeling awkward. It's as though I am returning to the original ME! Yay! I recently attended my nephews fifth birthday party at a giant trampoline gym. I was the only adult leaping all over the place with the kids. It was the most natural and joyful experience. My heart was open and full and I played as I did when I was a child, without an ounce of self consciousness. As I walked off the trampoline, one of the parents looked at me with such love and joy and said, ""That was amazing!"" Big smile. I highly recommend INFINITE LOVE to anyone who struggles with self love and acceptance. What a wonderous company. Thank you LOTUSWEI! You are a magical, soul quenching company and I am so grateful. And, p.s. I have tried sooo many things - but, I have never in these 54 years known anything as pure and true as this. I feel myself coming back to the one who loved with abandon. Yes! J Joanne This company is the best, the products really work if you choose what you need and stick with it. I love using mist, elixir and oils. I wish they did lip balms in more than one essence though. Highly recommend. J J.J. WOW!!! Without even thinking about it, I offered a spritz of the Infinite Love mist to a family member who I've often had a hard time connecting with. I'd been using it myself that day and just wanted to be polite and see if they were interested. Within minutes, they shared with me in this deep, vulnerable way. Their usual stubbornness and walls seemed to magically melt, and in turn I was able to hear them and see their point of view for what felt like the very first time. It was shocking. Truly. In the BEST way. I still can't quite believe it happened but I'm so happy it did!!! Thank you so much, Katie and Lotuswei team! <3 <3 <3 D D.H. Like a warm hug in a bottle After a few days of use I noticed that I am able to be more levelheaded in stressful situations. I also feel more at peace in general and felt the need to focus on self care. 1 2 3"

This Infinite Love scent is soooo amazing. I was sent a bag of these salts along with my Open Heart elixir because of a promo Lotus Wei was doing at the time and decided to hold off on using it until the Full Moon. I had such a wonderful experience using these. After soaking for about 30 min I noticed my skin super soft! I'm excited to try more!! :) D Devon Courtney Knight Effects just taking place When I bathe with these I bathe once a week for at least an hour to get the essences into my system. I've always resisted this blend as the essences don't feel like what I need to bring in love, but I thought I'd give it a shot. Lotus Wei Oils, Serums and Baths are for me, the most effective way of experiencing the essences. I'm sure something is happening with the aura mists and Honeys up until recently they were what I used the most but there is something about me that they aren't as effective as other flower essences when I use those forms. I thought it was a lotus wei thing but lotus wei has essences other essence providers do not so I figured I'd try them these others ways and that's the sweet spot for me. I think in these ways the energy of the essence actually makes it to my lower chakras and legs without changing first. So I love the bathes and this one is hitting from a bath about 6 weeks ago. I feel like the equivalent of when a pregnant woman is an emotional wreck on a sitcom. But I know it's for the best and how can you go wrong with rose? I will say for me, I need more than one packet though I know usually less is more with essences. Not for me, I need more than one packet. That's what the star deduction is for.

Balancing I purchased this mist with the intention of using it in my baby’s room, as a way to “settle” the space for rest. It is in fact settling and I use it throughout the house to spread the peace around. The scent is perfect. It only lingers briefly and is quietly refreshing. Will definitely be re-upping when I run out! Thank you for sharing your experience with Inner Peace Mist. We're so glad to hear that it has helped create a balanced and peaceful atmosphere in your baby's room. It's wonderful to know that you have found multiple uses for it throughout your home :) Wishing you continued tranquility. xoxo S S.S. A must have for everyone in the family! Hello Stephanie! Thank you for your positive feedback :) A Alice G.R. Inner Peace has a permanent spot on my nightstand I use Inner Peace every night (*with Quiet Mind) before bed. I mist my pillow as well. It's lusciously calming. I also use it to mist the air if their has been discord in my space. It has proven to soften, lighten and love that space. It literally melts bad vibes. I have used this essence the most to introduce friends and family to Lotuswei. The results are beautiful and profound. I watch their faces soften and open up into an innocent sweet relief. My nephew (* a little tense 5 year old) - loves this blend. After I misted him, he kept trying to grab it out of my hand. ""More! More!"" He went on. Then, I watched that little body relax deeply into his mothers arms. He turned to me and smiled wide. Precious. (*and you better believe his mother got familiar with the Lotuswei website after that. haha.) Another family member couldn't believe how wonderfully it affected him. That day was amazing. I literally misted everyone at a small family gathering and all the tension melted. I watched everyone connect and share openly in a very loving way. Lastly, I turned my (*very sensitive) sister onto this blend and now she, too, won't go without it. It has helped her with confidence and sleep. Highly recommend! Hey Alice! Thank you so much for taking the time to leave such heartfelt feedback for our Inner Peace Mist. We are so happy to hear that it has become a staple in your nightly routine and has had such a positive impact on your loved ones. It brings us joy to hear about your experiences using it. We hope that it continues to bring you and your family peace and relaxation. Thank you for recommending us to others! :) xoxo J Julie W. Loving this choice I'm enjoying this mist. However, I have a friend that is losing her sister to cancer, and I gifted her my bottle, I felt like she really needed it, and I did see that she used it right away so I'm really hoping it brings her a little relief. I reordered another for myself. Thank you for sharing your experience with our Inner Peace Mist. We are glad to hear that you are enjoying it and that you were able to gift it to a friend in need. We hope that it brings some relief to your friend during this difficult time. Thank you for reordering another bottle for yourself. We truly appreciate your support. Wishing you and your friend peace and comfort :) xoxo J Jennifer L. Promotes so much Peace Got this for my daughter who is pregnant with her first child, she is sleeping better, and feeling more peaceful! :) Love these mists! H H.D. Felt the tension just melt away! LOVE this scent! Each time I spray it, I can feel the tension just melt away. I love using it on a daily basis to work on releasing patterns of stress and overwhelm, but if I’m in an especially stressful moment I spray a couple extra sprays to help my body recalibrate to a calmer state. Love this spray so much! R Rosemary Stress relief A AMANDA D. Perfect This was purchased for a family member who has physical and mental disabilities, as well as anxiety. Since we started using this with her, she is much more peaceful, calm, and relaxed. She especially  loves having her sheets and pillow sprayed before bed. We think the dogs must like it too, because they are always around her. We will definitely be purchasing more of this, and looking into different blends as well. C C. Just like the name PEACE I love The Inner Peace Mist, it helps to either unwind or when you are in situations of stress. Working in the restaurant business, it can get very tough especially in 2021. This is 100% recommend it! 1 2 3"

They were both trying to process grief and make peace with what is left behind. Inner peace aids in processing the whole thing especially when it is a sudden, unexpected and unanticipated news. It takes the edge off this huge sudden impact and helps soothe the nervous system. C C.S. Keeping me peaceful all day! I really love my anointing oil and when I completed the quiz and got PEACE-wow, was that dead on!  It has been turbulent for all of us but going through the process of facing my husband's recent diagnosis of PTSD and TBI from a 20-year-old military injury in the midst of our consequentially discordant relationship-major need for peace in my life!  I am also a middle school teacher in a rough district so putting a little oil under my nose before donning my mask has been part of my morning ritual that I never miss.  Thanks so much for your amazing products! L L.M. Bedtime Ritual Love to use this oil while I'm winding down for bed. I honestly didn't feel as attracted to it initially as I have with other Lotuswei products until I realized I had used it super quickly! It's got a really lovely scent and makes me feel so luxurious. K Katharina Wonderful oil I've been using this oil during quite a stressful time, and it's been very soothing. I also love its smell of lavender and feel it pairs very well with the Rattlesnake Flower Elixir. This is going to be one of my Lotuswei staples :) N Nicholas B. Amazing product and customer service I had some initial issues regarding my order but customer service was amazing. They not only remedied the matter, they went the extra mile and did so while being both understanding and professional. This product is simply fantastic. The oil is easy on the skin, the scent is wonderful, and I've found it tremendously soothing & it helps me sleep. I simply love it. I will certainly be a returning, happy customer! D Dominique B. Exactly what it says! I am alternating between the Inner Peace & Infinite Love lines as needed. They are both helping me so much! I have a lot of issues with stress from trauma, etc. and I didn't believe Inner Peace would do much for me as I've tried an immense number of different things with very little discernible result. I was lucky enough to have a bag of the Inner Peace bath salts lying around from a gift with purchase promotion in the past. With nothing to lose, I decided to work with them and was surprised at how much better I felt. I had to get this anointing oil right away. It, in combination with Infinite Love, is definitely one of the best things I've found for my issues. It is truly powerful! S Swati P. Flower offering practice I purchased inner peace anointing oil to participate in the world-wide flower offering ceremony on 28-March-2021. I felt deeply connected to the offering and the community by using it on that day. I have a greater sense of relaxation whenever I use this. K Keelie W. Very relaxing! I love putting this on before bed. I rub it on my wrists, neck, and behind my ears. I use it as my final step in my skincare routine and it brings me peace, literally! T Timothy S. Gorgeous! This is the first anointing oil I ever tried from Lotus Wei. I was instantly in love!! Such a relaxing scent. These make such wonderful gifts!! Anyone I've ever given these to have been so grateful. Love this scent so much! B Bekah M. So calming I bought this as a gift for my dad based upon his quiz. He has used it for two days although initially skeptical, and is enjoying it. I also tried it and may buy one for myself because it is so calming! 1 2"

For me, less therapeutic and just more of a nice massage oil. Thank you so much for sharing your experience and for your honesty. It means a lot to hear how the remedies are landing for you. Just a sweet reminder to take things at your own pace. I know you already know this, but the botanical intelligence in the flower remedies works in harmony with your system—bringing to light only what you're truly ready to face. That said, it’s completely okay to scale back to just 1–2 times per day. These kinds of healing experiences, while sometimes intense, are temporary, and the discomfort doesn't last. Getting on a regular and consistent rhythm with the remedies can offer powerful, long-term support. And like you mentioned, using the oil or mist as a more luxurious or occasional practice is a beautiful way to ease into the experience. Trust your timing and intuition—there’s no “right” way to do it. We’re so grateful you're giving them a try and sending lots of support as things unfold. <3 d diana d. Beautiful smell Love the smell and just wish that it lasted longer. Use on pulse points , delightful smell, and then is soon gone. Open Heart suggests chocolate which is a smidgen of Angel that flies by quickly N N.L. So Sensual! My favorite way to use this serum is in the bath, and on my chest & feet before bed. I have anxiety that spikes at nighttime and including Infinite Love serum makes it so easy to calm down and cozy up in the evening. My partner also loves using it for massages S S.R. All is Well Im about to order another of this serum and felt to do a quick review.  Apart from the luscious scent, the minute I place this on my heart solar plexus area there is a calmness, centeredness, and 'all is well' in my world,  in a grounding, soft and sensuous way.  Where there may have been a disturbance beforehand, this is immediately centering and grounding in the heart.  It's powerful, and the fosters a true sense of wholeness. J J.J. Like Nurturing Love In A Bottle :) The scent of this serum absolutely matches the title. Using this makes me feel so nurtured and cared for. I also use it to give my boyfriend foot rubs and he loves it. :) Just a lovely, comforting experience every time I use it! S Sarah S. Feeling peaceful, radiant and at ease I love this serum as it unlocks a feeling of being held and at ease, in the most beautiful, feminine and nourishing essence.  Thank you for crafting this fusion of support and beauty that truly calls to me. R R.L. Incredible! Wow! It hasn't been very long since I've started using this serum, and I have to say that I am amazed at how quickly it works in helping you dissolve barriers that have hardened your heart space and continues to  stop you from forgiving and loving yourself and others. The effect for me was almost instantaneous. I noticed the very day I started using the serum that I was just more forgiving iand happy in general. It has also helped to bring experiences to my awareness that were still buried deep within that had been creating the blocks. I am excited to see what else comes up with time, and the changes it will help me effect! I have tried other products from Lotuswei, and I use them in conjunction with one another, but I always begin using an elixir separately to see how the individual combination elixir affects me, and this one was particularly fast in helping me create tangible changes (or I'm becoming aware more and more quickly with time). Whatever it may be, it's astounding and such a beautiful pleasure: a gift to you and the world. Thank you Katie Hess and the Team at Lotuswei! Much love and immense gratitude to you and our beautiful flower allies <3 Thank you! A Andrea Y.K. Calming rose I love the smell of this serum, it is light enough to spread everywhere but gives me the feeling of calm and self.  It reminds me to focus on myself and to calms the mind in the moment, as I let it soak in.  I have not yet seen an effect on my mood or of the people around me but I definitely feel the reminder to slow down and focus on myself. Will continue to use daily as I am enjoying the ritual and smell. N N.B. Relief! I've been suffering for 5 years and I've finally found the solution. Massage on stomach daily and they are greatly reduced. This is magic in a bottle. T Tiffani S. My favorite serum! I love the feel and scent of Infinite Love! I combine this with my diy serum and my skin loves it! It's a floral scent that isn't overwhelming and doesn't make my face feel oily. A great way to start your morning and I love to reapply later in the day. 1 2 3"

C Camélia This is magical I spray myself just before working and i am so productive and i have so much more energy! I can focus more and i accomplish things very quickly. Every task seams easy and i don't procrastinate anymore! I also sprayed my collegues and they were all amazed to see that it works every single time! i love this product so so much I will rebuy it for sure 😌 B Barbara P. Lightness of Being I have had health issues in the past three years, and I take several vitamin type supplements recommended by a naturopathic doctor.  I am doing hyperbaric oxygen treatments that are bringing back focus, clarity and organization from a concussion.  I give myself a light spraying of Inspired Action Mist after my morning supplements and it gives me courage, freedom and lightness. I believe that Inspired Action mist, together with Fierce Compassion has helped me to open to creativity--I am making small drawings during my oxygen treatments, as a practice, and Fierce Compassion has opened my support and love for others. L L.W. Dissolves procrastination I had a long list of to-do’s that felt very overwhelming. I took the flower quiz and received Inspired Action as my result so I decided to try it. It smells AMAZING and it truly works! I felt like the little energizer bunny just after a few days of using the mist consistently. Now I use it whenever I need a little extra motivation. N Natalia K. Gets you going The Inspired Action aura mist just gives me a nudge whenever I find myself procrastinating on a task or a project.  It takes the edge off the resistance and things get done seemingly without effort.  I'm always surprised at just how easy the task was. The scent is invigorating too! I Isabelle E. Jump start! Movement I love using this spray in my studio while I work! It's a beautiful essence that helps light a fire of focus and action. Definitely a staple to have around! I don't necessarily use it multiple times a day like i would use an elixir, but just a few pumps when I start working make a huge difference in my work flow. :) S S Y. I just finished a bottle I was gifted and am already missing it so much. This mist really helped me stay productive and get unstuck on so many different tasks, big and small. Need to purchase a bottle straight away... J Jeanne-Marie M. Wild creativity !! I'm so grateful for this blend. The mist is perfect (and fun!) to use while working on projects, especially writing for me. Often times, it's the getting started that I struggle with.. uncertainty about finding the topic or idea that aligns with my purpose and that will propel the work that follows. I know what's meant for me comes easily and Inspired Action helps to bring all the good stuff to the surface. Wild creativity really says it all! The scent is amazing too.. the citrus is like a sweet, gentle sting! <3 1 2"

I had been feeling stuck for months, spending most of my time, binge-watching videos instead of working on my project. However, Inspired Action Elixir has truly made a difference for me! There wasn’t a specific “Wow moment”, but on the third day of taking it, I suddenly noticed how focused and engaged I felt while working on my project - the video streaming was even off! Since that day I have experienced increased motivation, focus, decisiveness, and creativity. I continue to make progress on my project. Thank you! Wow, so incredible to hear about these amazing changes—thanks for sharing! K Kheru Inspired Action Soon as I received my order I took them right away. When I took the inspired action, I was able to breathe right away!!! Such a relief. Thank you. Kheru thank you! Here's to your inspired action and breathing into it more! xo B Berenice D. Inspired! I was definitely creative at cooking lately. Especially, with all the in season veggies & fruits.I've tried new produce & have been creating my own dishes. A flood of ideas i have been thinking about when it comes to the next meal. Below is a Nettle donut i had to make, amazing🫶🏼icing, maple butter, yum! Amazing Berenice! Looks so yummy! j joan R. Yes-flew through creating my new webiste Magically Lotuswei landed in my inbox at the right time and I ordered Inspired Action to stay focused and energized while creating my new website: https://www.encircles.us/.  Please check it out! Inspired Action helped make the process fun and a breeze. A A.S. Subtle but Profound Improvements I started with Inspired Action after consulting with Lisa as part of initiatives I started implementing for work life balance. Since I started using it (mist and essence) l noticed gradual and subtle changes with work tasks such as following up, following through, having fun at work and confidence as well. I am administering the flower essences formulations characterized in 3 levels: stabilization (Inspired Action), exploration (Gamechanger), and expansion (Inner Knowing). Verticalizing is resonating with each essence from each level: Feel good (immediate results), go deep and awaken. So I'm deep diving to be super intentional with the person I want to be. I believe these are therapeutical steps contributors to cementing self-love in all aspects of my life. K Kristen It got him up and  movin and making, creating!!  Just what he needed 🙌🏻 E E.d.L. So helpful!! I bought this for my husband's birthday and just before giving it to him, he got laid off of work. Whew - what timing! This essence really helped him stay with the process of ups and downs as he found a new job. He was like an inspired warrior meeting all the angst with discipline and vulnerability and connecting with Source. Thank you! C C.M. Best ADHD treatment I’ve been taking this, in conjunction with Rose of Venezuela, for a little over three weeks, and I am loving how much easier it is to focus and follow through. I am much more on top of to-do lists, and I don’t feel overwhelmed by big tasks and lots of details. This is the kind of blend that even makes doing taxes sound like a decent gig!! I run a business and was needed a blend that could help me get more done, but not slip into old workaholic tendencies. This worked wonders— I will be returning to this blend again and again. J Jodi W. Inspired Action wow! Inspired action has helped me  "" get Motivated"" ! I had felt very stuck and this seemed to pull me right out of it! Will definitely keep using it! Thanks so much for all you are doing. One request can we have a bigger bottle of flower elixirs I love them so much!!! ;)) B Beth F. Making life happen FOR me I feel motivated, a bit more confident (working on that one :)) and raring to go.

S Sana Healing from Sedona I live on the other side of the world but Sedona is one of my favorite sacred places! As soon as I opened up the bottle, I felt the difference from my other oils.

I ended up with Inner Peace, Wild Abundance & Expansive Presence. I’m much calmer. I don’t get triggered as fast as I used to. I still can get mad but I don’t fly off the handle anymore. There’s a softening to everything. Thank you! Wonderful! It's incredible to hear this is bringing you the calm and ease you deserve! E Ellen Inner Peace Having Inner Peace on my desk reminds me to take breaks, am definitely feeling the support and positive uplift during busy days. So wonderful to hear it is bringing you the support you need! A Annette Checks all my boxes. Must have. A Angela B. Inner peace I've been taking inner peace elixir for about 3 weeks now and I'm starting to reep the rewards. I'm not feeling that inner torment, feeling attacked as much and I'm not seeing all that chaos I once did. My mind is at peace nd it feels wonderful. Amazing product and flower essences♡♡♡ A A.D. True Inner Peace I revisited flower essences after taking a several year break, and this was one of the first one I worked with. What a delightful experience! I felt a shift quickly, within a few days. A calm sense of peacefulness was exactly what I experienced. The description of what it would magnify and dissolve was accurate for me. I credit the several flower essences I used last year with helping me gracefully move through tremendous change. If you're looking for a quiet, calm, and serene sense of being at peace, this is elixir is a fantastic place to start. J J. Instant relief I’m a new first time mom and on a particularly hard day I reached for my Inner Peace elixir. Immediately I felt a sense on calm and comfort. I couldn’t believe how quickly I felt relief. I originally bought this formula to help with confidence and being more comfortable speaking in public but boy am I grateful to have had it that day. J Jerrie S. Inner Peace I enjoy Inner Peace so much!! It was one of the first Lotus Wei products that I purchased. It helps to smooth out the ""rough edges"" in our day to day life. It reminds me to relax, recalibrate and reconnect with myself. S S.L. it's true This gives me the peaceful, quiet mind on those days and nights when my head won't let go of the noise. I have a bottle at my desk, my studio and my bedside table. K Kris A. Inner peace With the inner peace elixir I feel calmer and have a more positive outlook. K Ken W. Every night I've been using Inner Peace along with Quiet Mind every night before bedtime for quite a while. It improves the quality of my sleep and I don't travel with out them. Highly recommend these elixirs! 1 2 3"

It smells clean, refreshing and uplifting. First, lemony with floral notes and then the more earthy notes come through, the juniper, cardamom, and pepper. To me its evocative of how a clear woodsy breeze under an open sky with sun warming the skin feels.  Open.  Free.  I’ve used the anointing oil, spray, and EO to diffuse.  All are lovely. F Fonda Wonderful Scent Love the smell of this and how it makes me feel very centered! V Veronica Gorgeous & grounding This is one of my favorite scents. I've given it as a gift and all the recipients have liked it, too. It's a grounding, earthy smell (in the way that Palo Santo is, not like actual soil) that I can't get enough of. Brings me right back to center."

Starting the New Year with Joy~ I am new to Lotuswei. I am fascinated by this beautiful and informative website. I have been using Joy Juice spray with Inner Peace. I am, by nature, an overthinker and always play the worst case scenario in my head with everything.. It's been almost 2 weeks. What is intriguing to me is that I almost felt my anxiety heightened more at first. I seemed to have turned a corner this week and am feeling more relaxed, less monkey mind am exuding a calmer presence. I feel ready to face the New Year with hope, more self love, and will definitely be trying new products. I take very good care of myself, consider myself to be very healthy at 64, and look forward to this next chapter of my life using natural remedies, such as these delightful flower essences!! Welcome to the family, Lisa! Beautiful observation of the effects the flower essences had on your life. The heightened 'imbalance state' will sometimes occur to really shine light into our blind spots, making the transformative effect very noticeable on where it's smoothing out our kinks.  Happy New Year ~ and come visit us in Phoenix soon! :) R Rosemary B. Crabby No joy. First time in 3 years that joy juice hasn’t worked for me. I bought it for the holiday to be more playful but I’m just so miserable I had to stop taking it at this point. Thank you for sharing your experience. It sounds like what you're going through might be a temporary phase where old patterns are being released—this can feel tough at first, but it will pass soon, and you'll feel lighter and more aligned with your truth! T Toni A. Feeling grateful  -I actually made this purchase for my pet She is a five lb chihuahua- 16 years a seasoned bundle of love ❤️ she has arthritis among other physical symptoms She appears to appreciate this essence - seems to comfort her Thank you Hey Toni! We're so glad to hear that our Joy Juice Mist is helping your furry friend! We designed it to bring comfort and joy to all beings, and we're thrilled that it's making a positive difference for your 16-year-old chihuahua. Thank you for choosing us for your beloved pet. Wishing you both all the best! xoxo P Pam G. Grateful for this flower essence blend I have been using this flower essence blend for years when I got introduce to this from my old job when I worked at The Pearl Spa back home in Maryland. It brings out the best essence of my true inner child. One day I was giggling non stop with a co worker and it felt good. It gives me more light heartiness in a chaotic world. Hi there Pam! Thank you so much for taking the time to leave such a lovely review for our Joy Juice Mist. We are thrilled to hear that it has been a part of your self-care routine for years and that it brings out the best in your true inner child. We love hearing stories of how Joy Juice can bring joy and lightness in a chaotic world. Thank you for being here and for sharing your experience with us. Have a wonderful day! xoxo C Caroline I felt an instant cooling and calming on me as soon as I sprayed this on.  Gave me an instant smile and happy walk.  Definitely one for the handbag and car J Joanne Absolutely love this company- ordered from the US and arrived to the UK super quick. Much quicker than stuff I’ve ordered from the UK. All packaged so well. I’m super happy with this mist- I love to pick which I need each day. J J.M. Amazing All the wonderful items I purchased have made a made a joyful impact on my life. The smell of joy juice is beyond words Thank you M M. Uplifting I enjoy using this when feeling in the doldrums during a transition in my life. The uplifting scent breaks through the density and lifts my spirit, reminding me of Joy. P P.G. One of my favorites. I have been using Joy Juice for years now and it it one of my favorite of all the blends. It makes me feel extra silly and connect to my inner child. Also I feel a stronger connection with people when I use the lovely mist. 1 2 3"

It wasn't the scent that drew me to buy my first mist - it was the name.  Wisdom.  I wanted to start the year with some intentional words.  Generosity and Wisdom are my breaths this year.  So each night, a bit of Wisdom mist hits my pillow before I lay my head down, hoping to absorb what my self and soul have absorbed during the day - and allow wisdom to surround it, so the next day is fresh and ready.  So now - what is the scent of Generosity? Hi Roberta! I'm so happy this essence is resonating with you so well! As far as generosity goes, sounds like Infinite Love would be the perfect fit! :D c cory golden Guft Great service and product J Jini Patel Thompson My Favorite! I am so crazy for this mist my cells actually CRAVE it!! SO bummed to see it's sold out and hopefully you get more in.

It reminds me to play and have fun and realize that Joy is the best path. I have been using quite a lot of Joy juice in the last few months and I’m so appreciative of the OG formula! So happy you're feeling the magic of Joy! J Judith I bought this for myself and I absolutely love it. If I'm having a bad day it turns everything around. I got it as a gift for a friend this time. She loves it too! It's great to share a wonderfully made product with friends.

I Highly recommend it for anyone. N N.S. Effervescent This is in my top three favorite perfumes to wear (infinite love and full bloom are the other two). It is exactly what it says - joy juice. My perspective is more attuned to fun, laughter, and beauty when I wear this. C C.M. Love it I love joy juice and this was the first time trying the oil.  Oh my, the smell is so refreshing, it lifts my spirits.  I dab it on my wrists and on a bracelet and I find myself with my wrists at my nose so often.  Wow,  love it!!! R Robyn R. love this oil! I use this on my wrists and behind ears and inside of arm at elbow area, the scent is uplifting and playful. I use w the elixir. It really helps lighten up any heavy weight feelings. Something I always want to have on hand! A Amanda G. PURE MAGIC!!! First off, this anointing oil arrived on the perfect gloomy/monsoon day-just the pick me up I needed! Within two days of regular use I started to notice that I was dressing myself in more silly & mismatched clothes (such as a child would dress themselves). My music choice changed to more upbeat and fun music than I had been choosing the last few weeks. Ok, we’re on to something here… Now today was the real magic! My car started to smoke out of my vents-so as I waved it goodbye as the tow truck took it away I came straight home to put on some Joy Juice. Less than 5 minutes later I am eating ice cream from the container, listening to *NSYNC radio and dancing around my house! Normally I’d be overwhelmed with frustration in a situation like that but not today! Coincidence? I think not! Thank you Katie and the team at Lotuswei for giving me the gift of childlike JOY! D Debbie P. Love this little oil! I've used Joy Juice spray and elixir and was really excited to try it as an anointing oil too.  It has such a lovely fragrance and an amazing feeling comes over me whenever I open it.  I mixed it with Expansive Presence and Wild Abundance and it's the prettiest bouquet, I wear it as a purposeful perfume. R Rose D.A. Talk about Wow and Amazing As soon as I put on this anointing oil I felt an instant shift to Joy & Happiness. I felt great & giddy all day! I didn't even have to re-anoint. I did use this with the Game Changer anointing oil and all I can saw is wow and magical together. I will be using this combo everyday! S S Y. This really does work, apply some on my wrists and find myself laughing more and feeling like things are less complicated. M Micki K. Pinkalicious! Joy Juice anointing oil smells deliciously like bubble gum from my childhood and reminds me of being a little girl with no worries. It makes me smile. It’s a treat to open the bottle. Probably one of my favorites to provide lightness, love, and a bit of nostalgia. 1 2 3"

I was drawn to this but also somewhat reluctant to order because I have not noticed a big difference when using flower essences in the past.  But I am enjoying this product so much!  A few drops rubbed over my heart is very uplifting and it really does bring a feeling of joy.  Mixed with Wild Abundance it makes a beautiful perfume.  Thank you for creating this!   I can picture myself using this for a long time. C Catherine P. Very Effective I can say that it brings me a lot of joy, acceptance, and relaxation. T Timothy S. SO lovely!!! One of the first products I ever purchased from Lotus Wei over 3 years ago. Such a wonderful scent!! I find it has the ability to instantly put you in a good frame of mine. I share it with my coworkers so we are all feeling super happy :) H Holly D. LOVE I love everything that I’ve purchased from Lotus Wei! At first, I didn’t like the smell of Joy Juice. It was too florally for me. But now I LOVE it. I think I was so closed off to joy and softening my heart, that I couldn’t stand the smell. The more I used it, the more I fell in love!! My heart feels so open and light and it has freed me from taking everything so. dang. seriously. Just what I needed to help me find the fun, care free side of life! W Wendy N. Love love love This is my daily go to ritual for feeling good, balanced, and just plain happy! There is no doubt it is very powerful in its ability to balance my emotions. Love lovelove it!!! L Leslie S. An Amazing Lift I am a holistic RN, counselor and yoga teacher - most of my days are spent giving and helping others — the essence and scent of this serum is powerful. I find myself feeling and basking in its magic. It honestly makes me smile and feel more enlivened. Thank you for creating and sharing such amazing serums. K Karen F. I adore Joy Juice I am a metaphysical author,teacher, and energy healer, and I believe in holistic solutions including things like crystals, botanicals, flower essences. Joy Juice is simply wonderful - I've been recommending it to my readers and classes. I love the mission, the vision, and the product. Good stuff. :) C Cathy Be Joyful During the cold wintery months where sun is lacking. This is a must have for all, you will feel the laughter, joy and happiness return.

My Go-To Elixir When I feel the need to detach from relationships or situations that are problematic this is my go-to elixir. After a few days of taking the lilac elixir I sense a shift in my thinking and attitude, and this allows me to focus my energy in more productive ways. I have always been attracted to lilacs, and now I understand why. So grateful Lilac resonates with you and supports your journey! L Lyndsey S. A Special Reminder During a Difficult Time I lost a beloved family pet very recently. The days leading up to his death, I noticed an abundance of wild lilac and became very attracted to it. When my dog passed away I clipped the lilac and covered his body in the petals, as an offering of love and reverence. I purchased this elixir too. Lilac has helped me remember the impermenance of every moment and every being. Teaching me to love harder and live more in the moment. What a gift. Thank you so much for taking the time to leave such heartfelt feedback for our Lilac Elixir. We are deeply sorry for your loss and are touched to hear that Lilac was able to bring you some comfort during this difficult time. Your words remind us of the power of nature and the lessons it can teach us. We are grateful that Lilac played a small role in helping you remember to love harder and live in the moment. Take care! xoxo T Tiffany P. Letting go with grace This essence popped up just at the right time. Going through a transition with my ex and trying to sell our house. I went from constant worry over what would happen to a state of acceptance over the outcome. Will probably get a second bottle one this is done-it’s been allowing me to be more accepting of others as well and I have enjoyed being able to appreciate everyone as they are. Thanks for sharing with us, Tiffany! Lilac is so helpful in activating flexibility & full acceptance of things just as they are. I do want to let you know that the Lilac essence is also in our Boundless Wisdom Collection ~ which also has White Magnolia, Bodhi Leaf & Spotted Bee Balm. It's wonderful support for big transitional moments in our life too! Can read about the other flowers mentioned above here: https://www.lotuswei.com/blogs/blog/flower-bouquet-for-boundless-wisdom K K.K. Freedom Lilac Flower Essence is amazing.  It is a great teacher for letting go and acceptance. This also happens to be my favorite flower.  Thank you for offering this beautiful flower essence!! R R.B. Helped with my control I love Lilac elixir! I come from a background of single woman who carry a lot of masculine energy. We tend to be controlling and rigid in our belief system and we don't hold space for anything outside of that in our relationships. Which is a part of me that I have become aware of through shadow work and have worked to improve on. Although I did a lot of shadow work on this I still seemed to miss the mark, but after taking this elixir I was able to come to a place of accepting others and things as they are. It honestly feels so liberating to not hold on to MY version of what I want others to be and how I want them to behave.. it's like I was on autopilot and wanted to shut it off and finally found the off switch. LOVE! C Corinna J. Lilac Love Lilac is my favourite flower since I was a little girl and little did I know that what I needed was right in front of me. After using this elixir I feel more freedom and ease and the rigid structures I placed myself in and basically forced myself into have started to fall away. Also the constant need to be in control and the fear of the unknown have lessened a bit. I love this elixir and will continue to use it. H Hannah J. Tastes like heaven This flower essence called to me when I first saw it! I ended up getting a bottle the second time stopping by the spa that carries these. They always mist you when you're checking in! I feel like it has brought some extra positivity and patience into my life which I so desperately have been needing help with. Tastes great too when dropping directly under my tongue A Ariel H. I love lilacs in general, and really enjoyed this elixir. For me, I felt a deeper sense of freedom and less attachment to worry/stress, etc. D Denise S. My mother's favorite flower I can't say that I've been revolutionized, as I'm just beginning to enjoy this amazing product.   But, as I take the delicious drops, I am reminded of my beautiful mother, whose name was Lila and whose lilac tree is just now blooming. She left the earth over a year ago, in peace and luminous beauty.   I relish the taste as I enjoy her memory.   And, as i take the drops,  I remind myself that we are all as grass, a vapor, only here a little while.  Possessions we gather in our years really mean nothing.  It's what we hold in our hearts and our minds. Trembling at the beauty of what we have been gifted with in this life and being thankful for each and every breath . . . .   The moments of Lilac remind me of that. L Lindsey Really helps me Accept things as they are I have been taking this flower essence and Inner Peace for the last month. I really feel that this has helped me be more flexible in situations accept things as they are.  I normally hate been at home and would have been really frustrated and scared about the Covid-19 situation but I have been surprised of how well I have handled it. I have just accepted that there is nothing I can do and made the most of the situation.  This is not normally how I act...I just realized that it must be this Lilac flower essence that has helped! 1 2"

Talk about refreshing! When I take a bath with Moon Magic, I don't want to get out of the tub! It holds me, nurtures me and clears me of whatever heaviness I stepped into it with. I also use it in my shower. I plug the tub and sprinkle it on my body and on the floor of the tub. It's more than refreshing - it seems to love me back to a lighter, more grounded and exalted state. I also had my sister give it a go when she was struggling with some physical tension. She stayed in the bath through Katie's Moon Magic Mediation and additional meditations. Afterward, I noticed her eyes ~ they were so shiny and bright. She was grounded in a soft glow-y light. I hope someday Lotuswei sells a big bucket of Moon Magic. I'd be the first to buy it! Highly recommend! Delighted to hear this Alethea :) E Eleanor C. The Best Thing Ever I've used most of Lotuswei products and this one is the best. It's completely transformational, will shift you immediately and beautifully. I really would urge Lotuswei, for the good of all sensitive people in the world, to make a mist of this and a serum. It would transform the world 💛 L Lila Love this. I order several and tuck them into other little gifts for friends. J JACQUELINE M. Aromatic Bath Bliss! What an experience! Moon Magic Bath Salts left me feeling like a cotton ball blowing through the breeze. I absolutely loved it. The aroma is intoxicating and my bath water was soft and luxurious. The after-effects lasted for ages and left me feeling completely at peace and in the moment. I combined my magic with 1 cup of dead sea salts and 1 cup of magnesium flakes. Lotuswei makes me happy. Moon Magic has just been added to my growing bath ritual jewelry box and I thank you :) L Lisa M. One of my favorite things ever This is now on my top 10 favorite list of things I've done. So beautiful and luxurious and magical. Do the meditation - it's a must! T Ted F. Excellent product I gave these bath salts to my wife as part of an anniversary gift and she loved them! Great product. R R L. Fun! I added this a self cars cheer up during quarantine. It actually arrived on the full moon, so a good time to try it I guess.. Great scent, a bit magical, yes, and cheerful. Really liked it a lot. A Anastasia T. Refreshes your energy I wanted to save this bath salt for a special occasion. However, stuff happened and my energy felt really heavy for a while and I was struggling to keep my vibration up. The divine must have guided me because I saw a vision of putting a spoonful of these bath salts in a bucket and pouring it over my head when I showered (i don't have a bathtub, only a shower at home). It really worked and I strongly recommend ending your bath/shower with this after a long day. :) A Avon So amazing I literally had a religious experience. I made a wish to go with it. I put the mediations on and it kept going in and out.  The wish I made was to have something happened with my business due to the covid I felt so stuck. I had so many people contact me the very next day to book sessions and buy gift cards. this stuff really is magic. A Ariel H. Smells amazing I love using these around a full moon/new moon. Not only does it smell soo good, but you feel lighter afterward in the best sense. 1 2"

Powerful Substantial Change This Night Blooming Cereus elixir certainly catapulted me into a very different life, but it was not an easy ride! This is powerful stuff, it dropped me off a proverbial cliff into the most challenging and kinda terrifying time of my life, but I've learned to accept truths about my family that were painfully disillusioning and also learned my own strength and came to understand more what I REALLY want it of life. Sometimes the slate has to be wiped clean to get the new life. This elixir really made me hit bottom so that I was ready to climb the mountain meant for my best life. 🏆 (started this a year ago, Oct 2023. my life swiftly changed and I've been climbing to a stronger self since November 2023). Gabrielle thank you for sharing! So beautiful. N Natalie Absolutely loving this elixir. N N.C. Not sure but sure. I wasn't sure how to expect Night Blooming Cereus to work with me but I was truly looking forward to some clarity. However, the clarity came from a place I hadn't been in a very long time. Old insecurities have arisen, default old behavior patterns are trying to creep in. A heart heaviness and social withdrawal are engulfing me. It's all familiar though ('hello darkness my old friend' vibe) and this time I'm sitting with it all as a waypoint on my path to healing very old and very deep wounds. I love this flower gift my Lord Jesus has guided me to. He knows the depth of what is needed from His creation for us to fulfill His purpose for us. He knows how to fix me🙏🏽 D DANIELA P. Loving It I've taken Night Cereus for 1 week now. I feel a lot more relaxed, happier, self & others loving, confident. It helped me to read my tarot cards with more ease, it pinpointed  a ""shadow"" issue, quite a relief and it guided me to take another elixir-- which I'll take after I take the ones I've already bought; Wild Abundance and Inner Peace. J Julie S. Life changing This flower remedy truly helped improve my life.  I was stuck at a dead-end job and taking this remedy helped me take a leap of faith to leave.  The change wasn’t instant, but I ended up at a much better job in much better circumstances.  I credit this remedy for the courage I felt to make the change. A Aynsley L. Perfect timing, sums it up perfectly... My purchase of Night Blooming was not my choice. I purchased the kit, which included the Flower Evolution Book and Cards- which is what I was really after, and by default the Night Blooming Elixir comes with. I will say, I was pleased when it arrived, as I was in the midst of wanting a new career so badly...with claims like ""perfect timing"" and ""big leaps"", I could not help but believe this elixir came to me with a purpose and I would be getting a new job...I was taking it religiously (it tastes really good!!!) and covering myself in a different LOUTSWEI mist, just KNOWING I would see ""perfect timing"" present itself to me...and boy did it ever. Within weeks of using the LOTUSWEI products, this girl found herself growing a baby!! NOT the ""perfect timing"" I was anticipating for myself, but talk about big leaps for me!! I was not planning for a baby, I was so scared about the thought of having children, I felt so lost and in the middle of my sole purpose in life, and just reaching for something new and better for myself...well...I gladly blame LOTUSWEI...we are so excited...I tell everyone that wants a baby, ""try THIS"" because I truly think it was a major contribution!!! E Emma L. Amazing This is a flower essence that i have been immaculately drawn to twice. Once in full bloom and again last year. it's powerful yet also quite gentle. Instilling you with the last "" punch"" you need to truly go after something:) i recommend. A Anastasia T. A light in the dark I thought I was aware of the cause of my abandonment wounds till one afternoon when I was looking at them again. I took a few drops of this elixir and what unfolded astounded me. I actually recalled my first memory of abandonment as an infant. It's seriously mindblowing. A Avon I am in love ordering more I have been taking leaps and bounds in my biz. I seem to have more courage and strength to do the things that were holding me back. I will be keep buying this one for a long time. B Bekah M. This is my second bottle of the Cereus elixir! I can attest to what Alicia recounted here, that it seems the plant really does speed up on healing and materialization as well as forgoing fears that might have stagnated you before. I'm a fan of this one and very grateful for it :) 1 2 3"

Coming from space where I have lot of healing needed in these areas. I will be taking for next 5 months in order to feel more of desired qualities. Thank u lotuswei🩷 Thank you for sharing your beautiful journey! E Elizabeth V. Favorite Favorite flower and favorite flower essence. When I need more beauty in my life due to stress or really anything unnecessary, this helps dissolve it. ❤️ We’re so glad our flower essences bring you the beauty and calm you need! J Jaimie Z. What a Beautiful Experience! The Peony is one of my favorite flowers, and even more so now after using this magical elixir. I was actually more drawn to Peony for what it dissolves - mainly shame after ending an abusive relationship. Within 24 hours, I was feeling the feels! I had major emotions come up, but also major processing, insights, perspective shifts and absolute healing. It still amazes me the profound effect this essence had for me. After that, I have felt so safe, loving, forgiving towards myself, and appreciative. I've also had some interesting synchronicities, people and opportunities show up! :) S S.G. The Courage to Be Me I love the Peony Flower Elixir!  What I have noticed is that I am able to SHINE and let people see me.  I grew up in a home with domestic abuse.  It has been a lifelong pattern to blend in with the wallpaper in order to feel safe.  If they don't see me, I'll be safe.  The truth is that I have been safe for a long time.  I have so many amazing people in life.  It is ok for let myself be seen and heard.  It is time.  Peony Flower Elixir has given me the courage to be me.  It is time.  I have so much to share.  Thank you!  ❤️ J J.J. Made Me Feel More Deserving I found myself feeling more deserving when taking Peony. During my time taking it, I went for a few opportunities that I normally would have been too intimidated to try for. I also felt fancier in my own skin - more sensual and luxurious. Definitely enjoyed this one and would order again to go deeper! R Robyn R. Purchased for shame… I purchased this elixir after doing a search on getting help for healing and releasing shame. It is making a positive difference so far. I do notice some anxiety/fear and preoccupation arising, which is my partner to shame in my early trauma wounding… more able to express myself honestly and openly without the instant “I should not have said that” or “was it okay that I expressed that” coming up, or if it does, I can notice and not believe or act on it. This is a big issue for me so not expecting a quick fix but it is gently helping and working! Also noticing a realization of internal resourcing, not needing to look outside for what is already within me, which is a huge blessing. v vikki e. Feeling like its my turn to say no to overdoing for others, and saying YES to me! The slight and gentle turning of the tides. I am feeling more present and ok with doing things for my self. I always felt guilty and selfish when life needed taking care of ,for those around me, yet I pushed ""ME ' aside. After starting the peony elixir , I'm feeling empowered to say YEs to me😍 The guilt I felt for removing those around me that were energy vampires is shifting into positive energy for me. these essences have helped me at times just when I needed healing. I love to give them to my daughter and close friends to encourage them to seek the power of these beautiful elixirs. Thank You Lotuswei A Allison R. Sweet Peony! My favorite flower is the peony. I used to smell them and wish there was a drink made out of peonies because I’m so drawn to them. What a special find to learn about this elixir and the benefits of taking it. I do think it brings out my playful, grateful, and gracious traits! C Coleen C. Aligned I have been taking the Peony Elixir for a few weeks now and have noticed a shift! I feel more aligned and joyful. Highly recommend! D Dina Transformation This elixir did exactly what was indicated.  I felt so happy and abundance started flowing to me on all fotm.

D Dana Miracle I’ve tried so many different holistic things to help with mood over the years and nothing has competed with this. It’s been a game changer and I will continue to use it for a lifetime! Love it! Thanks for sharing this with us, Dana! xoxo R Rebecca S. Joy Juice shines a light on simple pleasures I am a healthy, emotionally balanced sensitive being giving 24/7 eldercare at home.  I am aware of the wonders and beauty around us, but felt a sense of lacking a general joy.  Since taking Joy Juice I walked past an aromatic Hosta flower and actually felt intense joy. Twenty years ago I added flowers that attract hummingbirds. For the first time, a week into Joy Juice, I've been seeing a hummingbird regularly in my yard.  There is an intensity that is difficult to put into words. It feels like the wonder that I usually experience has a intense glow to it, like the experience is lit up with a glow that is brighter and more sweet than before.  The moments that I bond with my mother are also sweeter and each of those moments have a palpable bright aura now.  I experience very little impatience since, as well. Thank you so much for your wonderful feedback on Joy Juice :) L Laura S. Gentle Flow of Joy Since using Joy Juice, I have felt more equanimity and acceptance. The shift is so subtle that I have to pause to consider it. I have experienced some moments of joy as awe and wonder at being human and the passage of time. I have been more patient relating to someone whose energy sometimes challenges me. If you are looking to allow the flow and enjoy life more, joy juice supports that positively. In my case it has been a subtle, gentle shift. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful feedback! j joey So yummy in taste and feels 😋 😍 s suze Love it C Carol D. Joy Juice gives me Joy! I'm the luckiest person around being able to take my Joy Juice to stay joyful! I am a music teacher in my home and whenever I expect  a student, I spray the elixir around the piano and in the air in the room to promote the joy we feel before the lesson! It works!

Carol DuBe, Denver Colorado G Grace I wish it was pink C Crystal Keeps me centered focused and able to get things done! A Aline S. I ordered joy juice ahead of my birthday. I planned a birthday trip and wanted it to be joyful. Joy Juice supported me with remaining grounded and in the moment. It specially helped me quickly snap out of after wake-up bad moods that take me awhile to shake off. What made me do too is crying for joy which I wasn't expecting.

I was told I had a gentle glow. B Billie W. Beautiful Elixir Pearl Elixir is now my favorite. I am seeing difficult situations in a more pleasant light. I'm feeling more alive and calm than I have in a long time. I have also noticed I am more forgiving of others and releasing any predetermined outcomes I might have expected. This is definitely going on subscription. I finally feel the inner peace I have been searching for take root. Thank you so much for this beautiful elixir. Pearls are one of my favorite stones. They are delicate yet strong with luster and shine. R Robyn R. My go to Elixir I have pearl on subscription! It is helping me to feel compassion toward, understand the integrity of, and slowly unwind the parts of myself that have been in hiding due to trauma and to develop patience w myself and others and life, and learn better deeper self care. I also have emotional eating issues which have been a lifelong challenge, and this is helping me w patience, faith, compassion, and slow change there too. D Debbie P. Patience, patience, patience... Patience is something I have a hard time with, and I was very drawn to this elixir to try and bring healing to this part of myself.  Also, pearl is my birthstone so I felt very connected to this elixir.  It's been 3 bottles and I feel so much peace that I wasn't feeling before.  Feels like a lot of magic! E Emma L. Subtle magic.. I was so excited to get the pearl elixir. Honestly i didn't notice such a huge difference after i had finished the essence, however i noticed i was still drawn to it and wanted more of it after my bottle was empty. I guess that's what the essence does, helps shape you into a more loving, gentle person with patience, with patience!:) Just like the pearl itself. So maybe a lot happened even when i myself didn't notice. I am more patient with myself now, though:) C Carrie H. Patience Patience is just what I needed this holiday season. Impatience with my emotions had me running away for mommy-time-outs too often before starting this elixir. I’m so much more at ease now, just a few extra seconds of patience and determination not to go “hide in my shell” gives me a chance to think up creative responses to all kinds of antics. M Margaret W. Strengthened my mothering & nurturing In the course of taking the pearl essence I started to develop my nurturing capacity most profoundly for myself. Ways I had chronically overlooked my own needs or been unaware of my needs started to surface, and learning to tend to myself in a newly loving way became natural. Additionally my internal stance around being a full time mother shifted from a feeling of ""not enoughness"" to a sense of real strength. A profound shift! S Stephanie H. I had been putting off a home project for months. I did everything I could to avoid it. But, when I started taking this elixir, on day 3, I woke up and started tackling the project. I didn't even think about it. I just went and started. I also started up my yoga practice again after some time away, and I feel like this elixir has made me more graceful. Pearl has helped me go inward, helped me to see what my priorities are; and has helped me to take the first steps to get to where I want to be.It's like a mom in a bottle in a way. Encouraging me forward, giving me that gentle push I needed. A Ariel H. Grace This is a beautiful elixir. I've always been drawn to pearls, and as soon as I took this the first time, I felt its effects immediately. I felt more patient, calm, and graceful. A Annalisa Embracing the unexpected This is my second elixir from Lotuswei. I have been a total mess, out of control,  as far as negativity and impatient behavior and irritability- darkness along those lines. I was thinking that flower essences weren't creating the shift to a nicer me at all, until today. The clouds broke and Light flooded me. I started having epiphany after epiphany, not only seeing myself for what I am, but also the way to get to a better me, knowing to the core what it is I do want. The upsets that I was experiencing for the past month suddenly were not bad- I intuitively understand they were part of the shift, almost like the poison that was released from my stuck emotions. Its been an incredible day. I still have over half a bottle full, and all I can think was, this elixir wasn't about me becoming more patient, nurturing and graceful, it was about me being cared for by this elixir in a patient, nurturing and graceful way while I was releasing. So now, I think I have room to become those things to others, or am on my way to that. My heart is full of gratitude."

I typically lay day and start processing through my day and now that I have been using Quiet Mind, I can easily drift off to sleep. The scent is delightful and light.  I am pleasantly surprised by such a noticeable difference.  I highly recommend it, especially if you have difficulty falling asleep. Love hearing you're drifting off to sleep easily, Katie! N N.P. Bedtime Massage oil. Use this serum daily before bed, rub the serum around and behind by ears, wrist, neck and soles of feet. Helps me relax and unwind with the soothing sent. Love this product and Lotuwei product. So happy it helps you unwind—thank you! R Rosie F. Best sleep ever! Discovered your product at a spa. It really helps me get a restful sleep. Love it! Thank you for sharing your experience with our Quiet Mind Serum. We are so happy to hear that it has helped you get a restful sleep - that's what it was created for primarily! We appreciate your support and hope you continue to enjoy the benefits of Quiet Mind :) L L.S. A peaceful & healing sleep. I've been working with Quiet Mind serum for years, and always come back to it. I get the most peaceful and healing sleep when I use Quiet Mind consistently. I love the scent and especially love that the serum does not have a strong scent - it is just perfect for when I want to come to a place of rest and stillness. B Brendan Genuinely helpful - just like the company. I was introduced to LOTUSWEI flower essences through my partner. She began using them to help support her when she worked a very stressful & demanding job. She recommend I try Quiet Mind to help me stop being too in my head and to switch off in the evening. I had such a hard time sleeping. After a week of applying this serum to the soles of my feet every night before bed (the scent by the way is really relaxing and lasts a while!), I was getting the BEST sleep of my life. The last time I slept this well was probably when I was a baby :) As a guy, I wouldn't have naturally been inclined to go and try flower essences. For starters, I had no idea what they even were! But flower essences work. They are so gentle and so impactful in how they weave their flower magic within us. I highly recommend LOTUSWEI, and their flower essences. They are genuinely helpful - just like the company. N N.A. Disappointed and a waste Very disappointed in this product. Asked about a return policy just in case it doesn’t work and was given the ‘I’ve been working with flowers for years, it’ll work’ attitude. That’s absolutely unacceptable. The scent doesn’t even last five minutes and $60 is a waste for a tiny bottle. Lotus Wei is nothing but a scam of false promises. They don’t care about your well-being, they want your money. Know the difference and look elsewhere. We appreciate the feedback you left. I'm very sorry to hear of your disappointment. In our communication last month, I did let you know that the scent in the serums won't last as long, and recommended our Anointing Oils, as an alternative. For us, it isn't just about scent but also about flower essence benefits. You haven't mentioned if Quiet Mind has helped you with sleep or relaxation. In our emails, I know that you needed support with that. It is always our mission to help our community through our care & support team, and through flower essences. I had awaited your response to my last email to you in December, but received no reply. Seeing this feedback surprised us even more because of that, as you can imagine. We're all so passionate about helping people and spreading the energetic healing benefits of flower essences. When I told you I was confident that they would help you, it truly came from the heart - it also came from years of working with them both personally and witnessing so much feedback from our community. Flowers helps us. They always have. They never hinder us. I trust that you know yourself best, and I'm sorry that you are so disappointed. It is never our intention to disappoint. I have sent you a refund for the serum today :) xoxo D D.B. Nightly ritual Quiet mind serum has become part of my nightly routine. I struggle at times to turn off my racing thoughts. Now after washing my face and putting on my pjs I rub quite mind on my arms, chest and the back of my neck before doing my relaxation meditation or reading. The smell helps me mentally slow.  The scent now triggers me to shift to slower breathing and note the thoughts that race to keep me awake instead of allowing them to take over. Thank you for quiet mind. C Carrie S. Better sleep and mood, plus less mental turmoil! I've been having trouble getting to sleep for some time now, despite taking numerous supplements that help me sleep soundly once I finally drift off. And my habit of overthinking and engaging in the roller coaster caused by crazy mental chatter is truly disturbing at times! This serum has been a godsend. Meditation usually helps me fall asleep but lately, my mental chatter is so loud once my head hits the pillow, I can't even focus on my guided meditation. I wanted to order the Quiet Mind Elixir but it was sold out, so I settled on the serum, despite being nervous that it would break me out (I'm hesitant to use anything that isn't pure grapeseed oil...my skin is SO finicky, I typically use elixirs only.) Then when I received my serum, I read that it is to be used IN CONJUNCTION with other Lotus Wei products. ""Oh no!"" I thought. ""Is it not going to work for me?? Should I have waited for the elixir?"" I felt skeptical and disappointed and then got worried that my skepticism, disappointment, and generally negative thinking would ENSURE that it didn't help me...overthinking is the WORST habit! I started applying the serum to the soles of my feet 5 times a day anyway (and occasionally to the back of my neck) and hoped for the best. Well, just a few days in, I'm floored. I'm suddenly getting to sleep quickly--AND sleeping a lovely 7.5 hours of deep, restorative sleep a night, despite being about to start my moon cycle, a time when I usually average just 5 hours a night! This is absolutely unheard of! And I feel more even-keeled. A situation came up that would usually send me into a neurotic thought spiral, and I calmly took some deep breaths and let the worry go. This stuff is phenomenal! Thank you, Lotus Wei, for once again giving me peace of mind and transformative results. <3 C Courtney K. I am HOOKED Wow. Is all I can say. I incorporate the serum as a moisturizer every day on my upper chest, neck, and on my face. I use it twice a day along with the anointing oil and aura mist up to 5 times per day. I absolutely love how it helps put my thoughts at ease and when I feel like I cannot get off the ledge myself. I cannot wait to continue using lotuswei and buying more products to support my holistic wellness and mental health. Thank you Lotuswei team! 1 2 3"

I really like the unique smell and it even helps with tension driving in the car! It helps clear and calm the mind, I am so glad I found this! L L. calming, amazing scent I loved the scent of this, I would apply it to my wrists any time I needed a little bit of calmness and peace. Such a lovely ritual. c cgeisz Rapid, profound results I've been using this essence for a bit more than a week and have noticed a deep shift in my mindset and stress levels. In the first 3-4 days of applying this regularly, I actually felt more stressed and panicked than usual, and my neck got so tense it was painful to swallow. However, on day 5, I felt all of that tension melt away. Since then, I've been so much more present with my family, way less stressed about the future, and feel like I'm floating through life in a new way. It's hard to explain exactly how and why I feel so different, but I highly recommend for all over-thinkers! D Debbie sooo relaxing! I love this annointing oil.  I started using the serum and then graduated to this oil.  It smells wonderful and helps relax me right away, and ease me into the best nights sleep! A Amanda A peace of mind leading to deep sleep The title says it all - this has helped a lot with my difficulty to fall asleep and stay asleep. I'm always thinking about work and etc; my mind is constantly racing and this has HELPED A LOT. I have tried melatonin, CBD oil, & valerian tea and a Quiet Mind has the one thing to really help me relax and fall asleep. I can feel all the tension leave from my neck and shoulders. I ran out of it months ago and I regret not repurchasing right away. I noticed I have been having difficulty falling asleep again. This is a MUST HAVE for me. 1 2 3"

When these details are taken care of you know the product will be outstanding. The flavor is heavenly, I love honey and this is honey with dimension! It is floral, slightly sweet and complex.

The delivery option was with DHL only - why? I was charged import fee at customs clearing, another expensive fee. I order online all the time, very rarely I have to pay for shipping and I have never paid for import duty. I will never order anything from your website again. We are sorry to hear of your experience. Unfortunately, our website experienced a shipping glitch at the time you ordered which meant only DHL showed up! This is not normal of course, because Fedex is also one of our trusted shipping carriers for international orders at checkout. This glitch has since been fixed, thankfully. Regarding customs/duties fees: this is sadly out of our control. Customs fees are applied at the destination country by customs, and not by us. This can be common for many of our international friends. We have stockists within Canada that you can order from to save on shipping and remove the likelihood of being charged at customs. Please find them here: https://www.lotuswei.com/pages/find-us We hope you can give us another chance! :) R R.B. Quiet Mind In need of quieting my mind and peace from endless thoughts & opinions. Going to give this a try for 3 months Thank you for giving Quiet Mind Elixir a try! We hope it helps bring you the peace and quiet you're looking for.

My word for 2024 is Simplify & this elixir has helped so much. I knew that I usually had a zillion unnecessary, not helpful thoughts in my monkey mind, but this showed me how many it really was. Most were stressful, which caused stress in my body & unrefreshing sleep. Now I can shut off those thoughts by thinking of one that I actually choose, such as I am now my Happy, Healthy Self--then it continues calmly without all the previous interference. I especially notice this effect at bedtime. Thank you!!! Thank you for taking the time to share your experience! We are so happy to hear that Quiet Mind has helped you simplify your thoughts & achieve a calmer mind. It's wonderful to know that you are noticing the positive effects, especially at bedtime.

If I wake up in the middle of the night, I simply put a few drops on pulse points and am easily back asleep. As someone who's struggled with sleep issues for years, this stuff is amazing! S S.L.

I can’t say I’ve noticed anything extraordinary, but if I really stopped to think about it, I have had a quieter mind when I go to sleep. I have only been using it morning, noon and night, and I read in another review. I should probably be using it at least five times a day, so I am going to try that. It smells amazing. I try to think and be intentional when I spray it about what a gift flowers and their essences are.  I am thankful for this product, and look forward to seeing even better results the longer I use it. Thank you for your kind words and thoughtful intention! D Denise A.G. So Helpful I ordered Quiet Mind Mist and Elixer because of my 'monkey brain' and I also wanted to add additional support to try quitting smoking.  Not quite over the cigarettes yet but my brain is slowing down and a I am feeling quieter internally and peaceful as my days progress.  I can't imagine now how I 'did' life without these products.  My prayer time and time with spouse is calm and fulfilling. So glad you're finding more peace—thank you! S Sam Little to no effect I've been using this for nearly a month now every night and yet several times a week my mind is still insanely active. I'll be up for hours just ruminating about the most random things.  Bummed... I thought I used one years ago and it helped but maybe it was the inner peace Thank you for sharing your honest feedback with us! Few questions for you: Are you using it 5x a day throughout the day or just at night? For the the most tangible results, it will be important to use it throughout the day. It won't put you to sleep when you need to be awake; rather, you will feel more focused & clear. For sleep, Quiet Mind helps quiets the mind & the body relax & let go. The next step is to to target the things you're ruminating. For example, I can share a personal experience. I was having a hard time sleeping once ... because there was hard conversation that I needed to have and was over-thinking it and avoiding. So on top of using Quiet Mind, I was also using Truthteller to help me speak my mind & lay it out on the table with fearless strength & conviction. If you're interested to work with something to target that second layer, the best way to figure that out is to take the flower quiz. Ask yourself: what is keeping me up at night? And then pick the flower & see what comes up. ***Update: We found that Inner Peace would be the best flower essence support. A Alice G.R. I Never Go Without Quiet Mind I use Quiet Mind every single night just prior to bedtime. I use the aura mist or the anointing oil. If I wake in the middle of the night, I mist myself (or anoint myself) five times and go right back to sleep. I like to anoint myself on the top of my head and I am liberal with it. I take my rest that seriously. And, my rest is restful. It's sweet. It's next level. I have also used Quiet Mind for a major panic attack during a period of time when I was contending with my stalker/neighbor. My heart used to pound out of my chest when suddenly confronted with that person. Quiet Mind sure got me through that. Stopped my panic. It took me out of dysregulation and calmed me right down. (*Very helpful when speaking with the police about this situation.) Quiet Mind, quite naturally allowed for me to breath into my belly and relax into myself with clarity. It held me in a clean and relaxed embrace. I also used Quiet Mind to assist an elderly friend when she fell in her apartment and needed help. She was crying out in anguish when I arrived. I immediately misted her entire body from head to toe. The effect was immediate. I watched her return to herself very quickly. Minutes. My sister now uses Quiet Mind to sleep every night as well. She is a very sensitive person and can't take melatonin or really much of anything for sleep at all and she was struggling. Now, she won't go without Quiet Mind either. It's also excellent for elders who are dealing with cognitive decline. I used to mist my mother at night and she always thanked me for it. It's an excellent one to carry in the car for that 'just in case' moment. Quiet Mind is nothing less than totally profound. I feel very lucky to have found it and this brilliant company. Thank you so much for your amazing feedback! We are so glad to hear that Quiet Mind has been such a helpful tool for you and your loved ones. We truly appreciate your support and are grateful to have you as part of our community. Thank you for sharing your experiences with us and for trusting us to provide you with flower remedies that help you find peace and relaxation.

My must have Quiet mind is my absolute go to these days . I love it so much and feel that I now never want to be without it. I spray myself and my pillow before  going to bed and find that the chatter in my mind diminishes and relaxation starts . If I wake in the night , I reach to my nightstand and do another quick spray . Combined with inner peace is a winning formula for me. Hey Gail! Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience with our Quiet Mind Mist. We are thrilled to hear that it has become a must-have product for you and that it has helped you find a sense of peace and relaxation before bedtime.

Perfect before sleep My first bottle of Quiet Mind arrived a few months ago. I use it before going to bed -- and it really does seem to make a difference in the quality of my sleep. I'm sleeping better for the most part, and it does help to quiet and calm down some of the mental chatter I used to experience in the evening. Both subtle and profound! I like it so much I just ordered a bottle for my office to quiet down the mental chatter there as well, and I've started to travel with a small bottle too. J J.G. Great It's Doing The Job R Rosemary Best sleep ever. J Julie W. Quiet Mind Of course I love the scent. I also like the effects of this mist. My mind is always going, sometimes with anxiety, sometimes with busyness, sometimes with good vibes... this mist has really helped me to focus and slow down a bit... I have been able to rest a little better as well. I have loved every purchase I've made, it's wonderful to have such a variety, we can choose what we need, work on it and then move onto something else... J J.H. Relaxing By far my favorite mist. I use it throughout the day and at bedtime I use it on the kids' pillows to help them go to sleep. 1 2 3"

I am perimenopausal and it helps me with balancing my emotions. J JM Unveiling of receiving wounds + profound insights This was a big one for me. The first week or so was really intense because I was seeing all these opportunities to receive and became acutely aware of how difficult it was for me - how unworthy I felt and how often I refused help when it was offered. I started taking Infinite Love to soften my experience and was then able to accept help, food, etc from my roommates and friends. I found that the guilt I felt upon actually receiving was minimal compared to the emotional paralysis I felt at the THOUGHT of receiving. Such a beautiful expansion to have witnessed in myself. This elixir has helped me make receiving a conscious practice, say yes when I want to, and let other people take responsibility for what they're offering. I'm so grateful!! <3 L Laura Receiving yourself I’ve taken this flower for essence a few times, and have often felt softer, deeply feminine, receptive. Today I began noticing how I can receive support, be less independent and ask for help. I had listened to a teaching of Katie Hess’ around receiving yourself and that really resonated. This flower essence helps me to fully love and accept myself, and feel worthy of love and support and all good things. Thank you! K Kate Winston Didn't even know I could use the help! Inner critic silenced. No kidding. Wow and thank you, thank you, thank you. R Rooz Profound Shift in Consciousness This flower has helped me to connect with my authentic heart. It has helped me to recognize that I am first and foremost a spiritual being, and that all success begins from living in that place.  As I have taken Red Cup Water Lily I have also become increasingly aware of negative beliefs and behaviors that are getting in the way of my growth and happiness, and am being guided to shed them one by one.  What an incredible gift. Thank you LotusWei. Love this, Rooz. Thank YOU for your commitment to your growth + happiness! <3"

Plus, there are lots of other additional noise factors, such as neighbours that wake me up super early in the morning. Then, a few weeks ago, our landlord announced that the roof (under which I live directly) had to be urgently redone, so I was desperately looking for a flower essence that would help me cope with even more noise. I am SO grateful for the Rattlesnake Flower Elixir – it has made such a difference, and I have been able to cope with it all SO MUCH BETTER than I ever thought I would be able to. I combined the elixir with products from the Inner Peace and Sacred Body ranges, which I felt complemented each other nicely. This will definitely be my go-to for stressful situations in which I desire some peace and quiet. I highly recommend it. Thanks for this amazing elixir, Lotuswei! D Debbie vacation in a bottle I got two bottles of this elixir - one for me and one for my boyfriend. It was so great to witness my boyfriend relax and have a calmer mind while taking Rattlesnake Flower - he has a really stressful job and I try to find different ways for him to relax and feel good.  This elixir definitely helps! D Debbie Amazing I was really intrigued to try this elixir after reading a blog Katie wrote about it.  I bought two bottles, one for me and one for my boyfriend who has a really stressful job.  I feel like the effects are subtle, amazing and powerful.  Feeling like I'm taking less on and letting things roll off my back easier.  My boyfriend had a huge shift at work after I started giving this to him which feels really magical. B Barbs Very effective! This was my second order of Lotus Wei products, since I find them so effective.  I chose Rattlesnake, since their description exactly describes my life:  under stress for so long, I don't even realize it anymore.  Even the first time I took this, I experienced immediate relief. I know it is supposed to take some time to notice the positive effects, but they hit me right away.  I only take it once a day because of this.  By the third day, I could see that I am moving in the world differently, effortlessly.  I had some very stressful events pop up this week on top of everything else, 2 weeks after taking it and others actually commented on how present and able to actually help others in the situation instead of being overwhelmed and collapsing into myself.  I'm feeling more in control of my life and have been able to make some decisions that had been difficult for me to face, but actually fell into place when I gave it the mind space.  I highly recommend this elixir if you are also looking to clear your head of the underlying noise in life and be able to focus on what is important to you.  Thank you Lotus for your high quality and good tasting product! T Tabitha Amazing This elixir is amazing! My experience with flower essences is that sometimes it can take a while to notice their effect. I’ve only been taking the rattlesnake elixir for a week, yet I have noticed a big difference. For me, this elixir goes to work almost immediately. I feel the results as soon as I take it. It’s stress relief in a bottle. I’m not using it as a quick fix. I have been working to release old patterns that no longer serve me, I am taking steps to destress my life, and I am creating a path to transition into a new job. I primarily purchased this elixir because in the description it said that it helps to dissolve constant stress and low level tension that have become normal. When I take it I feel relaxed, and things that would normally bother me don’t. I highly recommend giving this elixir a try. 1 2"

About a month ago, I was experiencing debilitating menstrual symptoms that left me exhausted and needing to rest at home. After just two weeks of taking the Lotus Wei elixir, I noticed a remarkable difference—my latest cycle came and went without the usual exhaustion or discomfort. I didn’t even realize my period was approaching because I felt so balanced and energized! This elixir has truly been transformative for my well-being. That's amazing to hear—thank you for sharing!!! L L.B. This was my first time using radiant energy and wow is it wonderful! I had been working overtime in an environment where the energy around me was not the most ideal. Radiant Energy really helped me feel like myself again and I no longer felt depleted at the end of the day. I also found myself adhering to boundaries I’d put in place which in the past I’ve had difficulty doing. Now it was instinctual. I’m definitely going to be ordering another bottle. I love it! S Samantha My husband has been taking this and I have noticed a dramatic change in him for the better. Grateful for this product, and that he remembers to take it everyday. J J.D. Huge Help This is my first time trying flower essences. I have had intense, unpredictable periods for awhile now and startling pain down my leg. I started taking Radiant Energy and within days I started my period. I waited in anticipation for my debilitating leg cramps but they never arrived. I am in awe and grateful for the connection this elixir has made with my body. J J.W. Use this one year round to get back to myself Radiant energy is the one I keep in the car and at the house. It helps me stay in my own energy ! My All time favorite ! It helps us highly empathic people get back to ourselves. J J.J. Absolutely Amazing! Got this elixir because I was having a hard time with period cramps every month. WOW did it help. Last month was the first time I tried it, along with the Radiant Energy Serum, and ZERO CRAMPS! It feels like a miracle to have found this - thank you Katie and Lotuswei! <3 FYI - I started the elixir about a week before my period and continued throughout and got great results. I use the Serum almost every night after showering, but during PMS/period time I upped my usage to 4-5x a day. Just ordered another round and am so grateful for this incredible plant magic. :) M M. Protection Prevention Progression I’ve been using Radiant Energy in multiple forms for years! As an all encompassing intense empath with clairsentience, I feel and endure any toxicity near me. Radiant energy elixir has been a constant aid in neutralizing any negative movement from becoming me. I like the protection it gives my ethereal body and my human spirit. I adore how it assists in preventing slips of stability as well as encouraging my progression of healing. K K.Y. So good for sensitive people! I've been using this one for about 2 months now. I notice that overall I'm feeling lighter, brighter and more energized. Also more optimistic and less depressed. As a highly sensitive empathic person, it's easy for me to take on the weight of the world and feel affected by the people and energy around me. I feel this supporting me in holding good energetic boundaries. It's too soon to tell for sure, but I think it might be helping me balance out my menstrual cycle. I just ordered some more (along with the serum & the anointing oil) as I feel this will be a good one to work with for at least the next few months. J Jona Great to be used at workplace I LOVE THIS SCENT. I use this elixir together with the spray because I find myself, too often than not, taking on the stress of others. After using Radiant Energy, I find myself ""more protected"", it's as if my inner voice is comforting me. I use this at my work place, mixing it in my water tumbler. I do not feel as mentally drained as I would, while working. I am also more mindful of my energies and this had helped me a lot in navigating through situations in my life. T T S. thank god for this I ordered this elixir radiant energy about two weeks ago, and it has been an absolute life saver.  I found out my man is skirting around my back with other women, on all sorts of dating and sex sites and hasn't been sober in days. Then things went off the rails at work and family in the hospital.  I have been able to maintain and remain calm.  THANKS! 1 2 3"

Smells good but there wasn't 4ml in my bottle It's smells lovely but unfortunately there wasn't a full 4ml in any of the anointing oils i purchased. Very disappointed because I wanted to love it. The exilers come with the full ml but I've only used it a couple times with 4 drops each time and it's already empty 😪 Hi Karley, I totally understand your concern! Our anointing oils actually come in a 5ml bottle, which we don’t fill completely as it causes leakage problems & causes the tops to become deformed. Because of the space left in the top of the bottle, the volume is 4ml for each anointing oil. I hope that’s helpful! L Lauren Great for low energy revitalization!! J J.J. In Love With This One! I adore the scent of this oil. Uplifting and delicious! I felt drawn to Radiant Energy, so I got this first to get a sense of the smell and was so glad I tried it. I'm thrilled to report that the Radiant Energy products have made a HUGE difference in my monthly cycle. Last month in addition to paying loving attention to my diet, exercise, and processing emotions, I used the elixir in conjunction with the serum and had ZERO cramps - miraculous! It's like a dream come true and I want to tell everyone! Also, interestingly, while working with Radiant Energy I found myself called to learn more about my monthly cycle which is big for me. For years I just tried to ignore it and push myself to keep on working hard even when I had my period and needed more rest. I felt immense embarrassment and distaste for my cycle and thought of it as an inconvenience. Radiant Energy helped me to get curious about what's actually happening in my body. I picked up 2 books about periods and recently felt called to map out my cycle and tailor activities to certain times of the month rather than fight my natural ebbs and flows. I even made a list of certain times in my cycles and treated myself to a few Lotuswei elixirs, mists, and oils that I felt intuitively called to. It felt like such a loving way to plan out the coming month! For the first time EVER I am working with my cycle and not against it - hooray! Thank you so very much, Katie and Lotuswei! <3 <3 <3 D Denise J. Beautiful At first the woodsy smell was not my favorite, but the more I use it the more it grows on me. Energetically I have felt a noticeable change within me. Along with the Radiant Energy Elixir, I feel so grounded and stable in who I am. I used to be a notorious people pleaser and was constantly anxious trying to anticipate the needs of others, always wanting a positive reaction and desiring constant validation from others. Also took on a lot of heaviness from others when they vented or looked to me for support. Using the Radiant Energy line, I am lovingly & beautifully reminded to stay grounded in my own radiant energy. I am encouraged & strengthened to be authentic, say no when I want to and just allow others to be who they are vs me worrying & internalizing the actions, words, emotions of others. It’s really really empowering! If you’re someone who struggles with taking on too much or being a people pleaser, I highly recommend this!! Love love love! R Rosemary B. Uplifting scent This scent is great and immediately uplifts me. It has helped with fatigue. I applied it on my stomach and got  my menstrual flow the next day after not having it for months. This is an amazing line K Kristen S. Grounding while energizing! I really enjoyed this oil. It truly did seem to give me energy while also leaving me focused and grounded. T Trinidad Excellent for 2021! Last year was challenging to everyone, we need the boost of energy to make sure we make the best of it in 2021 and adapt to the current circumstances. I recomend this anointing oil to someone who is searching for that power source recharge :) J Jada B. Trust Muscle Took the quiz, got radiant energy - at the time was planning a permanent move out of state, coming into full realization that I'd been in chronic low-level anxiety all year since spring, getting back into the office and spending SO MUCH TIME still and in front of a computer.  So, the description says, ""Dissolves: Fatigue after computer/cell phone use or air travel, overstimulation, taking on others' stress, feeling invisible, weak immune system.""  My experience was exactly that - I had some incredible, needed energetic purges occur during that time; I had two colleagues who discovered some huge physical/health changes occur who needed a lot of support and I was able to be there during that time; I also managed to uproot the past 18 years of becoming a woman in the city I resided in and began anew (which was a huge challenge) during that time.  There's not enough to say about subtle energetic shifts - you have to experience it for yourself and flex that trust muscle. J Jen L. If At First You Don't Like It... In 2016, I took the flower quiz.  I ordered Radiant Energy and Inner Peace oils, and the Infinite Love spray.  I think it may take awhile to transition to liking the smell of real flower fragrances when we are so used to artificial fragrances.  The only fragrance my family and I liked at the time was Infinite Love, but I kept the oils on a shelf.  Four years later, 2020, Lotuswei has come back through my life.  I took the flower quiz again.  I still had the oil, Radiant Energy, that was the result of my quiz this time around.  Now I use Radiant Energy at least five times a day.  I can say that now, I like the smell.  I'm even able to use Inner Peace, but it is almost like I ""need"" Radiant Energy.  The results of the quiz are that I absorb other people's energy, which feels draining, and I have to frequently be on electronics.  That is so true.  I am effected by how the people in my family feel, and when listening to others, I feel like I absorb what they are feeling.  It usually isn't a problem.  I love being there for people.  But with everything going on right now, I've been feeling completely overwhelmed with emotion.  I feel like Radiant Energy is a tool that will help me cope.  Putting it on at least five times a day is like a meditation practice.  It helps me return to the present moment, take a few breaths, and reconnect with myself and what is going on inside.  It has inspired me to try the elixir.  So if you receive an essence or oil you aren't fond of at first, my suggestion would be to try it for one week.  I think there can sometimes be an adjustment period.  Every review I've read on here said eventually, people came to like fragrances that they didn't like at first.

Feels organic, natural not willful. Also have noticed more ease around getting time in nature and exercise. I am going to continue using this elixir as it seems to assist with effortlessly shifting entrenched habits toward more healthy and self nurturing behaviors. Yay! We love to hear you're having a wonderful experience with Self Heal! W Wandalea W. Deep Restoration The Self-Heal Elixir gives me an immediate feeling of peace & restfulness, eliminating an underlying stress. I have since starting to take it reconnected with some other natural healing methods, nutrition, & a practice I had not done for years--talk about self-care! I am so on the mend. And I love the touch of honey so that it tastes delightful instead of the usual alcohol bite in other flower essences. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with our Self Heal Elixir, Wandalea! We are thrilled to hear that it has helped you find a sense of peace and restfulness, as well as reconnect with other natural healing methods. We are so glad to be a part of your self-care journey and appreciate your kind words about the taste of the elixir. We wish you continued wellness and happiness :) xoxo L Lisa M. Beautiful! I am loving the Self Healing elixir! I have noticed progress in my self care and feel more nurturing to myself which is exactly what I needed. I would definitely purchase Self Healing Elixir again. Loving all my LOTUSWEI products!! Thank you for bring these incredible products to the world!!💕 E E.C. Self heal This essence in particular has started working very quickly and often throughout the day. An emotional ping just rises up inside of me. I’m nothing that I can observe it, can’t change it so i acknowledge it and move on. I’d call that healing. My daughter and friends say I look very happy! I’ve been taking a bunch of different drugs ops together. Love them all. Started journaling too! S S.O.S. Self-Heal is the real deal My naturopath recommended your flower essences - and Self - Heal specifically - to help me get at the emotional cause of my constipation.  I love how gently and sympathetically it works with my own body, compared to harsh chemicals and even some herbal formulas I tried.  Using Self-Heal I welcome healing into me, from deep inside.  Thank you for such a lovely product. L L.F. Magical combination I just started using self heal elixir with luscious embodiment mist and all I can say it WOW!! After only one day of using this combo I woke up feeling energized and have an overall sense of well being. This is my first time having such fast and noticible difference using flower essence. I guess this is what happens when you give your body what it needs. Highly recommend both products. S S.B. Amazing! I have been taking this flower elixir for about 5 days and yesterday while I was falling asleep I remembered an event that really hurt me from my childhood but I was able to process it as an adult and I realized it shouldn’t hurt me anymore. It was amazing since I had forgotten that event. I thought the healing would be small, unnoticeable even but I’ve been having: small, medium and big healing moments since I started taking “self heal” flower elixir. I love these products! Thank you for creating them! K K.W. Unexpected Changes I snacked through the pandemic then a physical revealed some health issues, I had to make dietary changes. I was willing, but had to relearn grocery shopping and new recipes. I got Self Heal to assist with this, and I feel it offered support for the emotional part. Shame for taking bad habits so far, frustration with not having my comfort foods, fear that I couldn't turn things around. Self Heal has helped. Unexpectedly, this remedy also made me realize that I have to find another job. My current long time job is as unhealthy for my physical, emotional and mental health as my old diet was. I've started my job search and I've gone from terrified about this change to nervous but excited about finding a better job. S S.S. Eliminating all that is not loving from my life The first Elixir that I used and it clearly called to me. I used it for 4 weeks and felt that I was able to make loving nurturing choices for myself with ease (something I've been struggling with). The tendency to reach out for foods that are not good for me and bad habits - it really helped me get past that with ease, and it gently helped me make more loving and nurturing choices. Quite amazing. I did feel a healing crisis. I raised issues all around me and had a lot of confrontations, but it feels that it just wanted to eliminate everything that is not loving from my life. Astonishing. Thank you, Lotuswei. 🙏 J J. Self Heal Have been using SH for about 10 days and I feel more more motivated. Will. Continue to use. 1 2 3"

These are my first flower essences I have ever used and I am blown away. I am already out of the Boundless Wisdom spray (obsessed!) To be honest a ton has happened since starting it 5 times a day. The biggest was; I was told by the shared office group I work at about more strict rules and weird scheduling that rubbed me the wrong way. So I started looking for a new location and I immediately found a gorgeous space that would be all mine! This is going to change everything, I can really launch my healing business on my own and I am dreaming of woman’s circles in this space. This was not even on my radar before starting seedspark! I just starting adding the wild abundance and I cannot wait to see what happens. My business is going to launch, my income will double and I will be able more fully aligned with my values. Another note, I do feel a bit ungrounded, like the essences are bringing a lot up for me but it feels like part of the process. I love it and can’t wait to try more! N Natalia Koroleva Enchanting and grounding This Wild Abundance and Boundless Wisdom set were my introduction to Lotus Wei flower essences. And I love this combo so much! They worked very harmoniously together: the sweet jasmine based Wild Abundance aura mist just felt so expansive and opening.  While, more spicy frankincense-cardamom Boundless Wisdom felt very grounding and focused. The elixir was delicious and I felt drawn to take it throughout the day, experiencing moments of openness and deeper awareness. A AL Life enhancing These uplift the heart and mind energetically and with aroma therapy. I tend to reach for the mists when I’m pmsing and need a lift and I take the essence when I need some clarity L Li This combo worked for me almost instantly. When this was delivered to me, I accidentally locked myself out. My flatmate was sound asleep. I had no phone, and was still in my pyjamas. I was sleep deprived, and after banging on the door for 20 minutes with no result, I was super cranky. On top of that, my neighbours was cranky too. One had a crying baby and another was pumping loud angry music. I took the Seedspark combo, and started meditating in the hallway. Within 10 minutes, I was calmed and unbothered. I sat like this for almost two hours, in the noise, which normally is intolerable for me. I also love the smell of the sprays. It’s a treat for me every time I use it. E Emma Martin Enjoy the products I enjoy using the products throughout the day. I only give 4 stars, because for me, I enjoy using the Joy Juice blend the most. That being said, I may purchase the Wild Abundance mist again. 1 2 3"

Glowing from the inside out The Radiant Energy blend aura mist and serum have been the first products I’ve used from Lotus Wei. And all I can say is I’m blown away! The essences are so potent and I felt a shift the 2nd day of using them. I’m feeling more connected to myself and feel I’m receiving more insight and awareness to so many truths. It’s beautiful really to feel more connection to my soul. I use the serum over my lower abdomen and I noticed that my last cycle was lighter and shorter, and I experienced less pms. Hallelujah! I’ve been using many different modalities to help with my cycle and none have helped as much as this. I still can’t quite believe all the amazing shifts and benefits I’m seeing! I’m so grateful and am really excited for the journey ahead with the other essences. S S.G. healthy clearing and protection this is my second bottle of the Radiant Energy Balancing Serum and I love it! the flowers have supported me through some very uncomfortable conversations around respecting myself and my boundaries. which i never even knew existed before last year. i can feel the blend energetically protecting me from tons of fear and stress of others around me. and it's working synergistically with my body's own innate wisdom to reset my reproductive system after nearly two decades of an unfortunate prescription usage. and it smells delicious, of course! thank you lotuswei for the awesomeness of Radiant Energy! J J.J. Like Magic! I got this Serum and the Radiant Energy Elixir to try and lessen my monthly period cramps. They work like magic! I was astonished to experience ZERO CRAMPS last month - I'm stunned. Thank you SO MUCH Katie and Lotuswei. <3 I use the Serum at least 1x a day after I shower, but in the week leading up to my period and then during I used it 4-5x a day. It felt like loving support. I also love the scent - the warm woods and citrus description is perfect. HIGHLY recommend this one! K K.Y. I like this! I've been taking the radiant energy elixir for a couple months now, and recently got this to add to my radiant daily protocol. I love rubbing this one especially on my heart and my womb after a bath or a shower. I'm realizing that I'm enjoying working with this essence in a variety of ways including the serum, the anointing oil and the elixir. The oils this in this blend really match the energy of the flower essences. It feels like good medicine for me at a time when I'm wanting to protect myself from all the electronic devices in my world, to protect my fertility and also support me in creating clear boundaries in my life. S Saumya V. Breathing fresh I liked this product. It has helped me opening up myself as I felt lil less attacked by others energies and felt blocked energy melting somewhere. I was kind of expecting more with this aa i tried other serum ,it actually worked miraculously. I am still 2 months old here, .. overall experience has been good. C Chelsey G. I'd tried everything & finally relief! It feels like I've tried EVERYTHING to help, but no matter what, I'd still spend the first few days of my period doubled over, unable to leave my bed. I don't know how this is possible, but just two weeks of applying Radiant Energy serum to my belly (five times a day) and they have dialed back from a 9 to a 2! It also smells incredible! I can't speak highly enough of Katie and her flower essences! J Jeanne-Marie M. Regular periods My period now arrives on the same day every month! I use the serum once every morning on my sacral point and I am so far up to three months in a row of regular, normal flow periods - more consistent than it's ever been in my life. I am very excited to learn about moon cycles/phases now that my body has found its healthy rhythm. Thank you, LotusWei <3 L Lisa M. Wonderful for Zoom fatigue! Oh Radiant Energy, I love you so much. I bought the serum after loving the anointing oil and elixir and it has not disappointed. Radiant Energy has helped me a bit with painful and emotional periods and also, I had a virtual conference recently and by just the 2nd hour I was already burned out by Zoom fatigue. I grabbed this serum, rubbed it on my hands and within a few minutes I felt 100% better and the high-frequency irritation melted away. Amazing!  <3 A A. Smooth sailing through the lunar cycle I've been using Radiant Energy serum every day for over a year, sometimes 2x a day, rubbing it on right below my belly button. I noticed an immediate and ongoing elimination of rough menstrual pain. I got some for my tween daughter to make part of her moon ritual, so she never has to deal with dysfunctional cycles.  The best part is my insane mood swings have fallen to a natural level of response throughout the entire month. I will always!!! use this blend. Since we are on our screens all day every day, we are also detoxing from radiation, given the yarrow signature. J Jocelyn R. Felt it I used this consistently for about a week, at which point I remember applying it and vividly feeling a pleasant, energized state.  It was remarkable to feel the shift that clearly.  I like the smell of this one, it’s not sweet, but not woodsy, more cardamom or something.  Recommend 1 2 3"

I recently opened a sacred space to meet people face-to-face for energy alignment and trauma release.  Then, my time and attention were directed at caring for my father and supporting my sister and her family in a much more present and intense way.  I struggled daily with the fear of loss of opportunities. The elixir was a soothing balm and a gentle reminder to breathe, trust, relax, and know that everything is happening just the way it is meant to: for their and my benefit!   I also took Divine Timing, which really helped ease my fear.  I loved them together! Love that the Shower of Orchids suppported you in different (but also the same) ways based on where you were at. Flower side-kicks that always have our backs. :) V V.F. Subtly powerful This elixir was interesting. the shifts didn't feel as intense as most of the other elixirs I've been on. I ended up needing two bottles but this may be because it was helping to dissolve deeply-entrenched poor programming. The thing Shower of Orchids did for me is bridge the gap between consciously recognizing my own worth in my work environment and actually feeling it. I'm an overachiever and it comes from a place of never feeling like what I do is enough, or GOOD ENOUGH. In my mind I've known better but this helped the rest of me FEEL it. Shower of orchids was subtle, but powerful! Awesome! Thank you! k kelly s. Surprises and softens From the first time I took this elixir, I realized I was onto something special. This was exactly what I needed at exactly the right time. It softened parts of me that I didn't even realize had calcified; my interactions with others became more playful and light, and I found a sense of comfort in my own skin that I didn't realize just how much I'd been missing. As I continue to use it, the surprises keep opening up and subtle changes are allowed to unfold. I'm finding a greater facility with intuitive practices and more trust in my own instincts. This is definitely one of my favorite flower essences! A Ariel H. This was one of my early elixirs to try with Lotus Wei, and I wasn't sure what to expect, but was happily surprised by the results. For me, I felt much more secure in myself, and less concerned with other people's opinions. It also gave a sense of ease/grace in situations."

I use this mist as well as the Radiant Energy elixir for both myself and my 4 year-old daughter.  In her words, ""It's like all of the yucky things about the day get washed away"" when I spray us with the mist.  It makes us both feel calm and in a better mood.  A few times it has also helped us fend off some pre-school germs: we still got sick but only for a couple of days vs. some of our friends being down with the same bug for a week or more.  If I notice that I am not feeling like myself due to my energy being low, I use Radiant Energy and then feel better within a few minutes!  I work with clients as an intuitive coach, and I often drink the elixir throughout my workday to keep my aura strong.  This and Fierce Compassion are my go-to formulas for keeping my energetic boundaries clear so that I may best support my clients in a grounded way.  I've recommended Lotuswei products to many of my clients to further their continued growth and healing. R Ravan Loving this Feel good fragrance. P Pam G. One of my favorites. It helps me have more energy for every day life, love the smell of this flower essence blend. A shield of energetic protection. One of my favorites to take with me for traveling.

Simply the Best!! I love radiant energy. I use it throughout the year to keep me in my own energy. It helps  me feel grounded and following my path. Helps me let go of energy that is not mine!! Yay !! love this one!! S Samantha Literally the best just buy it C Corley M. Can’t go without This really is a staple, a must have in our house.  It is so refreshing and revitalizing to use, my energy levels shift dramatically after using it.  I will share some of the ways it’s been so beneficial for me and for my family. I’ve been aiming to balance my reproductive system as I’ve been healing from some past trauma.  It’s been very helpful in this regard. -Family travels at Christmas- this spray is a must have!!  Sadly I forgot to take it with us.  We visited various family members for many days, and as empaths, my family and I felt pretty off once we finally got home.   I literally couldn’t get off the couch.  Some misting of this and I felt so much lighter and motivated. We felt gross after long car rides and being exposed to a lot of Wi-Fi and electronics at relatives, this was so handy. This is literally a staple we must have on hand.  We use it regularly for so many different purposes. T Taryn P. Very Helpful! I bought Radiant Energy after reading the reviews. I work from home currently and communicate with people on the phone all day so it is very draining. I spray this mist between calls to help me stay present and not take on others stress. It has definitely helped me so much the last two weeks and I look forward to using it everyday! C Catherine V. Wanna feel like the queen that you are? With every spray i feel more and more radiant and regal ! It's a luxury, but it is definietly worth it. Helps me to feel the differienciation between my energies and other people energies.

I got a big project moving! I was facing a big project and was very overwhelmed. So I decided to purchase this true inspiration set. As soon as I started taking it, my feeling of overwhelm, ""I am not good at this"" dialogue stopped and I just started doing the thing. I wish I took this sooner! If I have a huge project coming up, I will remember to take this one in the future :) A Amanda M. Continually blown away! I am continually blown away by the effect of the Lotuswei products have on me! As a mother of two young ones with a full-time job who has been massively struggling with prioritization and feeling like a chicken with my head cut off I'm amazed by the effects the Lotuswei products have been having on me. Especially on habits I didn't really think would shift! I started with the True Change set, and then did the True Inspiration set and I am feeling so much effortless creative energy and the ability to get things done without stress or all of this mental build up and resistance against them. I feel a genuine shift that I feel is permanent because now I have this cellular memory of what it feels like to be productive without going about my day with stress. It's changed my mindset on a lot of things and I'm able to tend to my self-care, creative projects along with my to-do list with energy and excitement. Love, love, love Lotuswei!"

Repressed memory in dream I originally purchased this spotted bee balm elixer along with the full bloom elixer to help me ease my transition from being a smoker to a non-smoker. I do tend to carry a lot of stress. Mental stress. I also have had traumatic experiences from other things so when I read the description saying this elixer magnifies soothing calmness during a transition it seemed like a perfect fit for me. I didn't know what to expect as it was my first purchase. The first week I didn't feel much. Sometimes between my second and third week I had a repressed memory pop up when I was dreaming. It was as if I was there standing as I am now looking at the past but unable to do anything. Just watch. My father made me perform a sexual act on him. I noticed I was way too young to know what I was doing to him. I couldn't believe it! I was standing there screaming and yelling at him and crying. I woke up crying. Now I don't know what to do with that information. It wasn't a dream. It did happen. I forgot about it. I have not spoken to my father in many many years. This elixer did help me feel calm. I have felt calmer than usual. But I still do not know what to do with that information now. A Amy P. Soft and soothing I was intuitively guided to buy this after a big start to 2022 that I felt like I was still reeling from. This elixir helped me smooth out any internal lines that were still jaggered allowing me to lovingly steady myself on ‘the way’ thank you I loved it x J J.Y. Soothing calm during a period of deep healing I am very grateful for the Spotted Bee Balm Elixir.  I have been in an intense healing process - healing from a recent trauma that also triggered the resurfacing of a past traumatic event.  After only a week of taking this elixir, I have noticed a change in my ability to cope with day to day stresses.  I may be working through these issues for a little while but I feel the presence of this plant ally making the journey more bearable.  It is a soothing balm for my heart and mind.  Thank you very much. C Catherine P. Like a teddy bear for the spirit I started taking the Spotted Bee Balm to help with trauma that I carry around with me.  The Spotted Bee Balm seems to work with all the traumas of my life, some severe, some not so severe, collectively.  When I take the essence, it feels like a spiritual teddy bear.  I feel less stressed.  The essence feels similar to African daisy or Chocolate daisy in Joy Juice in that it brings up joy, but instead of like a sweet light turning on, it’s more of a slow moving sunrise, or a wonderful powerful warmth.  This essence has changed my yoga practice in that I feel more comfortable in my body. R Robyn R. For trauma Using spotted bee balm w a few others.,, emotions that were repressed from past trauma have surfaced for digesting. Very challenging. But able to keep going without despair and w the attitude that I am feeling safe and strong enough to face this and integrate and digest and release the pain and that I will feel transformed at the other side. The elixir helps me w self soothing and self love. R Rocio U. Just amazing! I’m in love with this elixir, I have been using Lotuswei elixir for the past 16 months and absolutely helping me in my journey, I start this special one two weeks ago and was just the perfect timing, the calm I feel, every day, start everyday hopeful and optimistic make me feel safe and peaceful, and going to a process with a loving heart , thank you! Thank you ! For this amazing product!!! C Customer Tough year We know that 2020 was tough, but the Spotted Bee Balm helped me a lot, the stress about losing family and friends. I have been taking it for a year, and it definitely helped me. I recommend to everyone. R Rosemary B. Wow I have been taking this elixir with infinite love, truth teller, and boundless wisdom spray mist been for a few weeks and it’s been a beautiful journey. I had been soul searching for some time but these elixirs helped me pin point exactly where I needed to look at.. and what came up was a bit different than what I was working on. It came up with ease and helped me really look at the issues vs just wanting them to hurry up and go away. Love these products C Corley M. Support My partner used this while addressing some challenging long-standing issues that were very hard.  In comparison with addressing them in the last, use of this elixir eased the pain and shock and trauma of them making them easier to address and navigate. 1 2"

So much creative flow Really felt a remarkable creative flow since taking this elixir!!! Ideas for work projects, inspiration and motivation to work on my art! Love love love it C Corley M. Creative Liberation I felt very drawn to this when I had become quite stuck in terms of creativity.  I literally felt a sense of lightness in my sacral chakra over the course of taking it.  One day, I found myself joyfully playing and making things, scribbling ideas on paper and realized this has helped me shift out of the creative block I was experiencing.  This very much resonates and may be one I come back to. A Alexandria C. Freedom From Creative Blockages I have always felt rather blocked creatively and this has been a source of great frustration throughout my life. This elixir has very softly been encouraging me to pursue creative projects and to take it slowly and be easy on myself as I work through these ancient blockages that are ready to be released. Thank you! E Ellie M. Balancing When I take this consistently, I feel much more balanced, spiritually and emotionally. Definitely a great addition to my daily self-care and self-love practice.

R Roselle Q. embodied This remedy has really helped me be more comfortable in my body and become more in touch with its needs.  I also noticed an increase in libido which was an unexpected and welcome surprise :) T Tabitha P. Explosion of creativity! I started off taking this elixir to assist with fertility. Instead, what’s developed is an amazing amount of creativity and inspiration! In the last 6 weeks I have birthed a 4-part course. I sat down to write one class, but material just keep pouring out of me. I highly recommend this essence to anyone having a creative block! That's amazing, Tabitha!  <3 D DIANA H. Great quality and tastes amazing I have been struggling with infertility for 6 years and PCOS is no joke. I have purchased this to help balance and promote a healthy body for a baby. It’s a bonus that is tastes great too! 1 2"

I am loving them and will continue to incorporate them into my wellness regime for a lifetime. V V.F. Feeling the love I'm certain I already started biofeedbacking this set before it arrived. I was already feeling more settled in my own skin and less insecure 2 days before it arrived. I've been on several essences now and have noticed this experience with every one of them, always start positively shifting in line with the essence properties 2 days before they arrive. THE DAY this set arrived, I immediately started using it! I was able to do 5 drops twice and use the aura mist and anointing oil before my husband came home from work. Our relationship had been tense and rocky for some time by this point. When he arrived at home, he sat down next to me and said in a way as if under a spell ""Wow, you look really good... I mean it... you're glowing..."" The same thing happened again the next day! 😍😍😍 It was as if he'd just seen me for the very first time. Also, it was as if my flowers were working on him too without him having to start flowers yet. This was months ago and he's been on a few flower essences now too. I'm quite certain these flowers have saved our marriage! Lotuswei is pure magic! A Ashley Love Infinite Love After taking the flower quiz my results told me what I had already thought. Infinite Love has helped bring back self-compassion and patience to my life. This year I have been practicing not giving away all of my energy and embracing what my own personal needs are. Infinite Love has been a great reminder to show myself grace and love each day. C Corinna J. Self-love I have a history of being harsh with myself and not allowing myself to rest, perfectionism, anger and resentment. I can't say that after a month of using the set 5 times a day all is well and the above are issues of the past but I notice a shift in my being. I am less reactive. I have started to take time to rest when I feel tired and to go to bed early. The constant pressure of having to do do do is greatly relieved and I am gentler with myself, both in how I care for myself as well as the ways I talk to myself. I am definitely take better care of myself and I feel a new sense of ease. I am also less harsh towards others and have more patience. While I still feel anger and resentment I am usually able to take a step back and not lash out immediately. It does not consume me as badly as it used to do. I can only recommend using the set if you have problems in the areas described and to keep using it. C Claudia M. Lovely Essence I got this lovely essence for my daughter. She is in love with it, she loves the smell. Not noticing a big difference but willing to continue using it. I will get back here as soon as she notice any experiences. K Kathy Love Infinite Love! I absolutely love Infinite Love! I have been using it daily and can feel a real difference. I feel more loving, accepting and calmer in general. I have also used this with my 4 cats, 2 of whom don't get along so well. Even they are calmer and much kinder to each other. I have since ordered a number of other products from this company and I have had an equally enjoyable experience with these products. I have used flower essences before from other companies and these serums and elixirs are by far my favorite! Thank you Katie Hess for these life-changing products and for your beautiful book! In-full-bloom, Kathy Oh wow, Kathy!  Thank YOU for sharing your experience ~ I love to hear you're noticing a difference with your cats as well. Much love to you!!! xoxoxo"

I have a perspective after adding Joy juice to my flower care. I dreaded flying and had to a couple of days ago. I took Joy juice 2 weeks prior. A day or two before I staithinkibg maybe I should think positively about it and set good intentions for the flight. Well I had the best flight all the way around. No anxiety at all. Everyone and the whole experience was dare I say it!!! Pleasant lol. We really can change our reality. I was peaceful and happy around the whole experience and Im enjoying my trip to see family. The flowers continue to amaze. M MP M. I will never be without Joy Juice If you can have a constitutional flower essence like a constitutional homeopathic remedy, Joy Juice would be mine!!  I can be overly serious and take on too much responsibility (any first borns relate?), this essence can change my perspective immediately, every single time!!! I truly love the Lotus Wei products and desire most of them but I always need Joy Juice ;). It's pure brilliance, giggles in a bottle!!"

Quiet Mind Set I bought the Quiet Mind set and I must say it is my secret weapon to getting centered and grounded. I absolutely love it and look forward to experiencing more. S Sonya L. Quiet mind magic Ordered quiet mind with my husband in mind. He has trouble sleeping. Happy to report he is sleeping better and has more drive and focus for his every day daily grind. I put the drops in his coffee. I also mist him before bed.  He is saying things like “I slept great last night”. Quiet mind is true magic! B Beth U. Quiet Mind and Self Heal I started with Quiet Mind and Self Heal and within a day I noticed things like being calmer in my daily activities. I wasn't rushing to be on to the next thing. I was tending to things with less thinking about it, just acting more effortlessly (less over-thinking) I've been clearing up clutter. And I realized I had taken a walk 4 days in a row (which I hadn't been making time for). The Mist and Anointing Oil smell divine and it's a sense pleasure to layer these with the elixirs. About a week into using these, I felt anger and frustration coming up a lot and felt like something was missing maybe I had chosen the ""wrong"" elixirs, but quickly came to the conclusion that I wanted to add Infinite Love in to the mix :)) Needed that layer of softness and heart-opening. I think they all support each other for me right now and I find my follow thru with Lotuswei products has been very good compared to others I've used. There is a Joy-full-ness and I just want to keep taking the drops and spraying the mists and applying the oils. J Jane M. Exquisite Self-Care Using the True Rest Set has allowed me to partake in one of the most exquisite acts of self-care I've ever experienced. The first spray of mist over my face and hands resulted in an immediate sense of pure bliss...a transformative, joyful, and lovely experience. I use all the elixir, the spray, and the serum throughout the day, and at night I spray the mist on my pillow and face. I also have my partner rub the serum onto the soles of my feet right before bed...a divine and nurturing ritual!! All of the products are truly magical, beautiful and transformative. My life has been enriched by the addition of these products...they constitute a sacred act of ritual, love, and self-care. Calm is a super power in my book, and the magic of Quiet Mind is its direct portal to sleep and serenity."

Lovely Lavender I love the scent of lavender so I was really happy with the anointing oil and aura mist. The large bottle of aura mists last for a while but I will order a new one when it is finished. Misting myself has given me an immediate sense of relief. For the first week I did not notice much but then I started to realise that I have become calmer and that it was easier for me to let things go and that I stopped continuously thinking about stuff. In general I found a sense of peace and calm even on busy and stressful days. A Arcadia Peace at last I bought this set as I teach at a college and I'm constantly surrounded by co-workers, students, and dealing with some minor medical issues that are causing undue stress. This set has helped me tremendously in not feeling overwhelmed and keeping the panicky feeling at bay.  It keeps me relaxed and calm.  I find that it works immediately on me too!  I use it first thing in the morning to keep my mind from racing on a busy day I will have ahead and I use it at night for the same reasons, so I can unwind and sleep.  I highly recommend this to anyone needing to feel relief from stress. Wonderful, Aj! So happy to hear you're finding benefit from the set. Much love to you, xoxo c chris carry awesome! I am so thankful and pleased with this set. I have all my bases covered. I use it everyday. I even use in as a freshener in my car. The smell just soothes me. It is my favorite scent. I am at peace wherever I go! Awesome, Chris! Thanks for sharing with us! L Lydia Brautigam Inner peace achieved I bought the inner peace set as a early Christmas present for myself. I was a little skeptical at first, but I was amazed at how I felt so calm and at peace when I used the products. I developed a new level of confidence which also brought me great security to my life. I tried the products on my husband and he had the best night of sleep ever.  I could see the change in him, he was more relaxed and was at peace with himself. Amazing! Thanks for spreading the flower-powered peaceful vibes to your husband, too! Much love to you, Lydia! xo"

This may be my all time favorite flower. Maybe I think that about all of them in the beginning!? But no, seriously, working with Wild Pansy is so much fun for me! I really do feel unleashed and uninhibited and it has brought me great joy to just witness an unleashing of self expression in people around me who aren't even taking her...it's just a potent field that she is impacting. As the flowers or any plant medicine promises, I have also been taken through the other side as well. A situation arose that had me sit with awkwardness and unease and the experience of feeling rejected. The beautiful thing is that with this flower power I was able to consciously or more consciously than my teenage years be able to sit with and look at the discomfort and move out the emotion from a witness perspective rather than being so identified with the hurt. I am grateful to have moved this unprocessed and young energy out of the body. On the other side I have definitely been feeling more at home and at peace in my body and with myself. I highly recommend this flower! (Especially because there is this beautiful and gentle way that she has helped me to relive unconscious teenage year emotional experiences integrating them with love, and the clear seeing of consciousness rather than when I was a teen how so many emotions and events like for most of us left us/me feeling dissociated and checking out/numbing and without sufficient tools to integrate these experiences in the body, mind and spirit. I should also mention I have paired this essence with Sacred Awareness another true gem! Thank you Lotuswei...you have done it again! Big hugs and love to all :) R Rosemary Benitez Social anxiety This has helped me alot with relieving the anxiety I get before speaking to others. I will be taking this one for the next couple months to see the full effects of it because I have really limited myself in many opportunities due to social anxiety. So grateful that there is a flower elixir for this, Thank you Lotuswei. S Sara Foster Sweet results! I love taking this so much that I ordered two this time!  I struggle with feeling awkward and sometimes shy.  I love how this makes me feel more ease and grace in life!  I feel that this year is a perfect time to feel the effects of flower essences, especially from Lotus Wei, because the world is so heavy and changing so much.  Helps take the edge off and reminds you to see the beauty! S Stephanie Bold I took this as directed and after the first week, I felt more bold in my opinions/actions. I applied for jobs that I wasn't quite qualified for, but took the chance anyway. I stepped out of my comfort zone more and feel like I am heading in the right direction after years of doing what I ""should"". S SproutGirl Whoa! Truth Teller I love this flower essence. I took this when I was on the Flower Evolution program.  It is incredibly hard to describe but when I took this flower essence, it gave me the courage, let's say ""balls"" to address an issue with a person who I really wanted to address a long standing issue with. I remember days before I addressed my issue, how much I just wanted to speak out and no matter what, I just needed to do it. Normally I would have found a way to convince myself to not address the issue. Without the aid of ths flower essence, I would never have had the courage to address something that was really important to me. Thank you for all that you guys do! I really appreciate you guys!"

We were all in survival mode dealing with my Mom’s memory loss. We each started our own combination of essences that we were drawn to. This is one I’ve been using on my pulse points and the scent is really nice. I feel a softening towards myself and everything I’m dealing with. I initially felt overwhelmed about using it 5x a day, but I bring it in my bag and easily put it on the pulse points. I really look forward to it and sometimes 5x doesn’t feel like enough! Thank you! Grateful it brings softness and support—thank you! M Marie J. Subtle yet potent It was a quiet subtle shift in moods emotions in just the  first three days.

Fierce Compassion This was my first experience with a flower essence and it was such a beautiful experience.....I am hooked.

Softening I must say I have been much less hard of myself and no beating myself up for everything. This oil is helping me break out of the old programming that nothing is ever good enough that I do and allowing me to grow into softness instead of those hard jagged edges that I developed as a child when Nothing was good enough. It’s helped me to love ME and that I truly am enough and this journey is for me and here to teach me. This oil is unburdening my heart and it’s busting out of its shell to be more lighthearted and have compassion for myself and my journey. K K.S. Simply Amazing. The Fierce Compassion anointing oil has been the fastest-working blend for me! Within minutes, there is a noticeable sense of softness and ease. It also helps me feel more present for myself and others. It's amazing, I'm ordering another ASAP. Thank you, Lotus Wei! Wow! So wonderful to hear! If you like acupressure rituals, check out this post: https://www.lotuswei.com/blogs/blog/tcm-acupressure-ritual-with-flower-essences It shares the perfect point to apply this anointing oil! Though, anywhere on the body is perfect & effective! ; ) Thanks for the love! p pessel s. complex I wasn't sure about the scent at first, but agree with a previous review that it has more to do with coming into alignment with the energy profile of the flowers. I find this blend soothing and empowering at once and find that a little goes a long way. E Emily B. Sweet surrender I love the fragrance of this blend. I can see myself sticking with this oil for a while because I love the way it smells and the way I feel wearing it. It is truly a gift to be immersed in the energy of the essence and sharing it as I walk about my day. I've been feeling more peaceful and softer towards myself and others. L Libby B. Fiercely Yummy I initially tried Fierce Compassion as an aura spray and as many others have commented, I wasn't so sure about it at first. However, I think my aversion to the scent was more tied to the energetic component of coming into alignment with a self-compassion that was new to me. Over time I found myself almost craving the scent and worrying that I would run out of the aura spray. After using the infinite love oil, I was ready to order a second bottle however I kept feeling drawn to ordering the fierce compassion oil instead. Since I have infinite love in the aura spray and serum I figured I would listen to my gut and get the fierce compassion anointing oil. I really do love it and I keep some in a rollerball necklace that I wear regularly. I find myself putting it on without even thinking throughout the day. The smell is so sultry without being overpowering. I think of it as kind of being like Infinite Love's big sister. It's the energy of loving fearlessly with a wisdom that is gained through truly living. I really love this scent and look forward to seeing how it continues to aid in my journey of self-love and compassion. t teresa t. Deep compassion Fierce Compassion came through for me.. While Traveling, lots of obstacles were coming up, faster than i could manage. Had the small bottle of Fierce Compassion oil in my purse and within minutes of applying, i suddenly felt not only grounded , but i could see that we were all doing our  best with what we had in the moment. i had compassion, not just for myself, but for the ""problem people"" and obstacles. i keep my bottle close at hand while i work..it's a very deep fragrance (think deep ruby) but as it opens and shifts your energy, you begin to smell lighter roses and pink accents. This fragrance is intense but as it works, it becomes voluptuous. interesting that the fragrance changes as your perception changes. . 1 2 3"

Literally Lovely I recently started using Fierce Compassion and have been beautifully satisfied with the experience thus far. It  is everything it says and then some. I’m still learning, but it has definitely brought about healthy and deep shifting in my life. Looking forward to trying more of the Lotus Wei products! Or all of them! J Jessie P. Hilarious observation and dissolving of a core fear I am a live in care giver to a female elder and her adult son. I chose to work with them because they are open to all of the healing art skills I have to share. Flower essences work with precious, immediacy, with the elder, I care for. I will give her a single flower and she will, after putting the drops on her tongue… almost exhale immediately, and say a sentence that describes the healing qualities of the flower without knowing what the flower is. It’s extraordinary to observe as a flower essence practioner and to simply be a witness too. That said, one night we were all sitting on the patio and I came out with a new bottle of Fierce Compassion. I gave some to all of us by tongue and then put drops in our beverages we were drinking, It. Was. Hilarious. Within minutes of being given Fierce compassion my elder looked at her son with the fiercest of love and professed “I LOVE you heaps and bunches and (I can’t remember the third adjective). She has memory loss so she would turn to him every few minutes and profess the fiercest of love. Her son had a giggle about the flowers acting so quickly every time she interrupted his story he fell into. Meanwhile, he started in on a story that turned into a 45 minute journey. Where we all wept and laughed as he reminisced about when as a single father he began to make good money he and his boys bought lots of toys at Christmas time and for years this became a tradition, of finding out by word of mouth, a few families that might be having a hard time and knocking on their doors, in a Santa suit and his sons dressed as elves, with a big sac of presents to deliver gifts to the whole family. Essentially, he ended up sharing the fiercest compassionate act he and his children did for years at Christmas time. It was a hilarious scene on the patio that night and so magical to observe observe as a flower essence practioner. When I pointed that the story he told us the night before was essentially the fiercest act of compassion he’s ever exhibited the next morning; we had a good giggle. His mother also the next day slipped into the beginning stages of the dying process: fierce compassion I believe deeply dissolved this core fear and ego Will around not being able to accept this next stage in her process. Sooooo beautiful and what a way to slide into the realm of hospice for us all? Fierce compassion is like inviting a deep blessing upon yourself and others. I then ordered inner peace and sacred heart for hospice times more reviews to come…flowers are magic in the death process🌷🌹🌺. T T.s.A. Soft and transformative I started using fierce compassion elixir, spray and serum about 4 weeks now and I can truly feel a shift. My boyfriend also using this now + our dog gets some spray and serum. Wow -  the first weeks I got thru some healing crises, and a lot of stuff where coming up for both of us. Some patterns, communication issues, inner wounds and a lot of information. And to truly see what we need to work on with a loving awareness, and it’s become more deep and still. So much love in seeing this, and to accept this as a soul study. Mirror each other, and the full potential we can unlock. I also notice the softness in my, and my inner dialogue change. I see my self and people with more love and compassion, and see they wounds and the soul study they are in 🌺 I I. Soft and powerful I have been doing self-help type work for a few years but was hitting a wall and couldn't process things that I knew to be true. Like I couldn't feel them to move through them. Within the first five minutes of taking this elixir I was able to remember memories I had long since tucked away and feel feelings that were so buried. It was excruciating and very painful but freeing in an exquisite way. I am so grateful to have found Lotuswei and I will be a forever customer. Thank you so very much. B Bridget O. This essence brings an element of acceptance without the feeling of carrying a burden. Due to this release I have found it energizes me on a different level, my energy is lighter and I do not feel as fatigued. E Emily Y. Makes me smile!! I LOVE the using the Fierce Compassion Elixer product! It makes me smile just to look at the bottle, then the delicious honey flavor makes my mouth happy, and the vibrancy I feel inside my being was an unexpected experience that now I get to appreciate again and again! Having the “be kind to yourself” image on my phone screen saver has also been a beautiful reminder and I’m starting to recognize how hard I’ve been on myself for so many years and now it’s much easier to let that go and truly be kind to myself! Thank you for creating this amazing product! Can’t wait to try more. Y YR The unconscious: Conscious Within the first 30 minutes of taking it, I began immediately noticing my inner dialogue changing  and my mind started to be kinder to myself. That day and night I started to feel more open and loving towards myself and in the coming days I started to open to the idea that I need to nourish and be kind to myself. Then another layer came in of dealing with self esteem & self worth as the unconscious became conscious. Within 3-4 days my inner landscape shifted and I realized we need to nourish ourselves not only with the food we give ourselves but the thoughts we tell ourselves. I don't recommend this to anyone that wants to stay the same, but I recommend it to everyone that wants to connect and realize their higher self! R Rosemary B. Gentleness I love fierce compassion. As I do my inner healing work and take an honest assessment of self, taking fierce compassion helps me to be gentle with myself, to love myself no matter the mistakes and move forward. Love it, it’s like the best friend everyone needs. A Ashley M. Gentle Yet Unrelenting I have dabbled with a few flower essences in the past and had considered doing them again when an ad for Lotuswei showed up in my social media. I took the quiz and started with fierce compassion. The description was spot on to what I have been working on- healing from several relationship patterns that have created complex trauma. Although I have been working on my healing for a few years- this has brought up layers upon layers more buried in my subconscious that I have not been able to access to this point….I didn’t even realize it was there! I think I spent most of the first 2 weeks in a healing crisis but ironically- today I was just telling my husband that I can tell the page has turned and I received an email asking for my feedback! I had my 2 kids and husband all take the quiz and they were ALL a perfect match. We’ve all been using the products religiously- sometimes swapping and sharing and I am starting to see a difference in the energy of everyone! I am excited to try other products and am already planning to incorporate them into my healing services for my business as well. I Isabelle E. Letting go/ releasing deep emotions This essence was intense, yet necessary for me. Revival of deep heartbreak, plus an entire 7 year friendship (with ambiguous romantic tones) ended. It was for the best, but it brought about big shifts for sure. i felt this energetically in my heart and womb. Sexual trauma came up to be sat with. Nothing felt unmanageable though, and I'm really grateful it all resurfaced to be released. definitely felt a deep clearing and surrendering. Feeling much lighter now :) 1 2 3"

Sublime Something so magical happens when I spray fierce compassion mist, I just love how I can shift from emotional pain  to clam and peaceful . A blessing !!!!! Happy to hear that's what it's doing for you, Chantal! :) T T.C. Intoxicating, truly I'm starting to sound like a broken record to describe these scents but I can't think of another word to do them justice - this is yet another intoxicating blend that I can't get enough of and I would bathe in it all day if I could! I came to Fierce Compassion after a particularly rough week where I was feeling ""attacked,"" and since then I've felt so much softening, openness, and tenderness towards myself. I also had a wild experience today where I misted myself and I immediately felt a clearing in my crown - the contrast was so stark, so immediate, so palpable, like somebody just popped a bubble and whatever was there just vanished into thin air. And now I have all this energy?? LotusWei's magic never ceases to amaze. Here's to further softening, openness and tenderness! Thrilled for you :) M Marsha D. Gentle I so enjoy the scent and sprain it on daily. I’m starting to feel a gentleness and a softening around my heart and I’m not afraid. The opposite of fear is love ~ & fierce compassion. Love it, Marsha! L Lauren So amazing! Delighted to hear :) O Olivia G. sacred pause This feels every time like a sacred pause which reconnects me to grace Wonderful to hear this! Thank you do much for sharing!! J J.H. Earthy sensual infusion First, the scent is unusual and addictive: a blend of earth and rose. It's more grounded feeling than Infinite Love--rather than being uplifting, it's a more rooted heart energy. Confident. Sensual. Clear. I've found men in particular love the earthy scent when I mist them with it. Fierce Compassion feels heart-opening, but not in a vulnerable way--more in a steady way. I'm hooked and ordering another bottle! Thank you! Love this so much and YES! A deeply earthy, sensual and grounding experience! Xoxo S Susan G. Self compassion I am undergoing chemo and this was a mist I ordered, along with a couple others that is helping me on my healing journey. It has really helped open up my heart to remind me to take special care of myself. I also feel it has reminded me of having compassion for my husband who is helping me so much. I feel embraced be it comfort each time I use it. Susan :) Thank you so much for sharing your experience! Happy it is supporting through chemo and having compassion for your husband Xoxo D D.F.S. Come bk to ME This fragrance is so lovely and uplifting. It brings me back to me,  to my heart , to my self. I’m returning to who, and what really matters which, of course is ourselves . We usually tend to be the last thing we take care of so every time I spray it, I am reminded, and it reminds me to stay present, and compassionate to myself first A A.C. Magnetic Fierce Compassion is like that painting that stops you in the museum and you have to sit down to drink it in.

It reminds me of the energy I want to carry through my day. I tune into a source of love. The smell is so expansive and grounding at the same time. Love it! Can’t recommend it enough! E Eshe K True Vitality Four months ago, I received a small sample bottle of Infinite Love from someone. I had never heard of Lotus Wei before. Having used essential oils for more than 20 years and educated in Aromatherapy I was happy to find that this was real stuff, not some synthetic room mist. So, I looked up the website out of curiosity. After taking the flower test I ordered Total Abundance as my first set. Radiant Energy and the True Vitality set came up in my second flower test. The description was again spot on. Taking in other people’s energy, fatigue after computer use and second chakra stuff. When I first tried it, I didn’t like the scent of it that much. It was very different from Total Abundance, which I loved. I decided to use it as recommended anyway and after a while, I came to love the scent of Radiant Energy too. There is something very refreshing and uplifting about it. I think it really helps strengthening my personal energy field and I have used it before some challenging meetings with good results. What I notice after having used different flower essences for four months, is that there is a subtle shift to more flow in my life. Things seem to work themselves out more smoothly. Maybe because I feel more relaxed and content, more in the present moment, and more in tune with my intuitive side. I have just started with Fierce Compassion after the name came up in a dream! So grateful to have found Lotus Wei, the products are amazing, and the shipping is very effective, even overseas to Europe."

Definitely a regular and new favourite! C Corinna J. Deeply nourishing I bought the serum to support myself through a difficult situation. I was deeply nourishing to check in with myself several times a day and see how I feel, how I am really doing and to be honest with myself. Over time I became more aware of my inner states, allowed myself to rest and developed a better sense of myself and more self-love and appreciation. I love how the flower essences gently heal old patterns. Stuff comes up but I seem to have more distance and a different perspective and so the shift happens with more ease and grace and a lot less struggle. The scent is well described and at first I did not like it but it grew on me over time. A Anne Who doesn’t need compassion? The smell is well described. I like using this in conjunction with infinite love mist. Although there’s a lot I do to promote inner well being, these flower combos are a big help! 1 2 3"

I'm putting a few drops in all beverages and a full dropperful in my water bottle. The honey in Lotus Wei's blends are a really nice luxurious touch. I got this after taking the master quiz and I immediately felt like the jasmine was working on me to accept all of myself. such a radical and much needed shift since as a woman i feel like my appearance is always up for scrutiny. my self confidence has increased and I feel like my most beautiful, radiant self. Thank you Katie and these beautiful flower teachers for their blessings. love is all around <3 Daniela! Super thrilled for you, for your experience. xoxo N Nina K. Not what I was hoping for I’ve taken flower essence before and had some minor changes and or a shift in emotions.  I was really drawn to Wild Abundance as I’ve been going through a very difficult time for almost a year now and I’m at my breaking point.  I’ve been on a healing journey for quite some time  and believe this would be a good add to my healing.  It just had no significant changes that I could write about. Mood and energy has been the same since prior to taking this elixir.  My challenges  seem to ware me down, but I wake up everyday fighting for the relief!  It will come but maybe this was not the best elixir for me?  Everyone is different and so many people here have had great benefits.  If you’re drawn to it - then try it and see.  🫶🏼 Nina, sorry to hear that your elixir didn't seem to be a good fit. Did you take the Flower Quiz on the upper left of the Home page? That will help you pinpoint which one you need first. Based on your brief description, you may want to consider Sacred Body or Inner Peace. Sacred Body contains Self-Heal, which is good for helping the body thrive, and Inner Peace has Hibiscus flower remedy in it, which is good for seeing light at the end of the tunnel after a long period of stress. Do either of these resonate with you? T T S. It's Working :) I have had health issues with both knees being replaced this year.  Having been ""down"" for a few months I have been obsessing about money issues, how things are going to get paid spiraling down down down into a deep depression.  When everything went 25% off this month I jumped on the chance to try Wild Abundance.  Figured what the hell can't get any worse right ? Well I have been using the essence for about 3 weeks now and I am much better.  No money hasn't showed up in my mailbox or my checking account unfortunately but I am feeling better about life in general. I'm walking the dog a mile a day and I have shifted my focus onto much healthier things in general.  All this has been very subtle but slowly coming to the surface and I am sleeping MUCH better which has helped life in general. Though I am retired and have to save for these essences I will continue to do so.  Thank for the 25% off or I would have never been able to afford this wonderful Elixir! Hey T! Ah this has brought such happiness to my day hearing your experience - I know I have spoken to you over email. I remember you :) Absolutely thrilled for you! Please have a look at the bonus treasures we have that can compliment your Wild Abundance elixir. I'll leave them below for you - there are meditations, podcasts and journal prompts. They all really help! https://www.lotuswei.com/pages/wild-abundance-treasures xoxo K K.W. within 24 hours I took my first dose on Thursday night after receiving it in the mail.  On Friday I won a free bikini and necklace ($300 worth), and I love jewelry and bikinis lol.  I have been saving and spending less so this was a surprise! Looking forward to taking it regularly and seeing what happens. Since then, a few days now, there have been some interesting opportunities in areas where there had been nothing but blocks.  So cool! D D.M. I can hardly believe it - but it works!!! I’ve been using the Wild Abundance Elixir for about two weeks now. A few days ago I was hit with life altering news and yet I was able to deal with it REALLY WELL. Overall I’m really enjoying it!! I’ve bought two more different blends!! J Joanne Love the elixirs from this company, they are incredible! They really work if you honestly choose what it is you need help and support with. Use as often as you can! Highly recommend P P.B. A New Experience I am a skeptic by nature. I had my doubts that this elixir would work but thought I would give it a try. Nothing ventured nothing gained so to speak. The Elixir tastes good and while my experience has been subtle, I have begun to notice differences in the way I see life in general. I feel calmer and more aware of negative thoughts that flow through my mind which allows me to redirect and restate those negative thoughts into thoughts of abundance. K Kimberly Great! A A.H. A favorite This bottle opened me up...in the most beautiful and transcendent way. I found myself whispering offerings of gratitude throughout the day, to truly be in love with all aspects of my life. What a gift this elder has been! T Tiffany P. Love it! Since taking this blend it feels like I see opportunities where there were none. Ideas I never considered or crossed my mind have been a constant over the past week and a half. It is definitely making me more optimistic and “go with the flow” will definitely keep around with my other staple, infinite love 1 2 3"

This smell is my childhood. I can’t quite explain the remembrance it gives me but it’s a true gift!! I smile every time I spray it! It brings me wayyyy back. Love that it brings you back with a smile! z zelda Amazing synchronicities! It amazed me that I kept having synchronicities when taking this essence.  I kept running into people I had been romantically interested in that I hadn't seen in years.  I really did think there was a connection to taking this essence.  Perhaps more energetic awareness.  I've taken this a number of times now and always find it fulfilling and wonderful to take!  My mom bought me the oil for Christmas, and I cannot think of a more delicious, scented oil blend that I have tried in my entire life!  I cannot recommend this blend highly enough! The synchronicities you are expereincing are incredible! So glad you are loving the blend! A Annalisa Incredible! I am developing my wealth consciousness, and this flower frequency is helping to manifest this in tangible ways. For instance, something I did not expect was to have my hourly rate doubled! No lie! Eager to see what else manifests, with a playful sense of wonder. Amazing! Love hearing how the flower frequency is working! S Stef Life changing I nearly fell over the first time I sprayed Wild Abundance - it was the most incredible scent I had ever smelled! Clearly this was the flower essence for me! I cannot stand artificial fragrances or perfumes, so this is a wonderful substitute, and it does so much more. (The concentration of the scent isn't over powering, but lingers for hours.) Ever since I started using it, waves of unexpected abundance, financial windfalls, free travel, free tickets, and deep discounts have come into my life....in the tens of thousands of dollars received and saved! Miracles have been falling into my life that I didn't see coming. Can I give all the credit to this little bottle? I'm not sure, but I can tell you I won't be going without it ever again!

It makes me feel like a beautiful Queen and a Goddess - magnetic, luminous and treasured. I use it on my feet at night as Katie suggests, and after showering I rub it over my body. It’s heady, flowery, indulgent and very special. Treat yourself… S Shannon G. flower power in abundance :-) i've been using wild abundance balancing serum for two weeks now and last night all of a sudden i felt my sense of lack evaporate. a beautiful sunset, a foo fighters song, and an amazing employee at the grocery store are all elements that were there for me before. the difference is the wild abundance :-).  i felt that life keeps getting better. i'm more enlightened and empowered and aware and caring and compassionate and loving and joyful and happy than i've ever been in my life. all expanding further with delightful laughter.  thank you so much to katie and the lotuswei team! i'm going to copy your closing and say love & flower petals, shannon K Katharina Feels divine and luscious I love treating myself to a little massage with the Wild Abundance Serum, preferably on my feet or my chest. Peonies are some of my favourite flowers, so it feels wonderful to connect with them in such a way. I will definitely try out the serums from the other ranges in the future. (Anyone else feeling like they want to try ALL the Lotuswei products? ;)) Thanks again, as always, Lotuswei, for creating such flower magic. x S S Y. Love this serum as a complement to the anointing oil. Both smell amazing if you love jasmine and floral scents. J Jane S. after shower I use this after my showers-- extra attention near my heart, belly and bum! Truly a beautiful and sophisticated serum that helps me refocus on my beauty and nurturing it D Dominique B. euphoria <3 Using anything from the Wild Abundance collection just makes me feel like I'm in a fantasy world, where everything is beautiful & easy! I find it very difficult to relax, but the energy within this serum (and the other Wild Abundance items) helps me release a bit and get into a more 'flowing' state. I absolutely adore this serum, it's such a perfect, sensual treat! Jasmine has always been my favorite flower, so I'm sure that's one of the reasons this line resonates with me so much; but Peony has also recently started to compete with Jasmine for the top spot (only because of Lotus Wei! I never would've felt the incredible power of Peony if it weren't for you guys). I can't believe how stunning & transformative Peony is. Wild Abundance really brings together some of the most divine flowers for an incomparable experience! d dariya z. Adore I love this serum. It brings joy and magic into the everyday. The everyday starts to become synonymous with simple, gentle magic. It's also great that loved ones tell me I smell like flowers after I've put it on - and truly, this serum reminds me of peonies, both in essence and in scent (and it's one of the flower essences inside!). One of my favourite LotusWei combinations. Thanks so much for creating it!"

So glad you love it! Enjoy every spritz! C Cathi R. Game Changer IS a Game Changer In my daily life as an HR Manager - I find myself spritzing more often.  Game Changer is a tremendous help assisting with every issue that walks into my office. By night I have a Reflexology & Reiki practice. Game Changer helps to keep me in tune and beyond! I strongly recommend ! So glad it’s making such a difference for you! M Mariana S. Game Changer truly is I've been using Game Changer mist for a few weeks now. I love the smell but I love the experience even more. I feel confident and ready for my day and when I spray it during the day the feeling amplifies. Mariana delighted for you! Thank you! :) J Joel P. Game changer for my team I manage a street medicine outreach team and have been sharing the joy of the game changer mist and luscious embodiment anointing oil, receiving much gratitude from all.

I feel like it tickles my aura and feels so amazing. I will definitely travel with it to feel refreshed after flying on a plane. A Allison M. Presence and spaciousness I just finished my 1oz bottle of game changer today, the same day I got an email from LotusWei reminding me I received it 14 days ago - 14 days?! I thought it had been much longer - pointing to two intentional words on the bottle, ""rapid growth."" The amount of presence I've felt and mental spaciousness in challenging situations and conversations has been incredibly noticeable. I can also say that I've experienced out-of-the box-thinking in my patterns of self-observation that has allowed me to have a lot of breakthroughs on the way to healing and revising old and unhelpful patterns. T TIFFANI S. Motivation and Manifestation For me, Game Changer cuts through procrastination like nothing else! A lot of times I'm wrestling with myself to do something or get things done in that moment. Since using game charger, I no longer have to force myself to do things. I've realized certain actions were just busy work or self sabotaging and won't get me closer to my goals. Game Changer shines a light on what really needs to be done, what's the action of distraction, and what needs to be but can wait for a more opportune time. I no longer keep a long To Do list. Things are getting done effortlessly in more creative and playful ways. J Jacqueline B. Lush & recharging I adore this spray! And appreciate being able to enjoy the flower essence magic in this modality as well. This spray grounds me and sparks me simultaneously. I do feel like I'm misting myself with the prana of the rainforest! xoxo S Samantha M. Literal Gamechanger! This was recommended by the lovely folks here when I replied to an email stating I need more joy in my life. I combined this with Joy Juice and instantly felt giddy! It was incredible, the shift was ⚡ quick. This and Joy Juice elixir are a power couple for sure. I mist myself whenever I need a shift, and it works like a charm. When I am annoyed, stressed, or overwhelmed by life I mist this and my energy shifts to the flip side. Buy this, you'll see everything from a fresh perspective without even trying! H Holly D. Deep Breath in a Bottle! First off, the smell of the Gamechanger mist is absolutely intoxicating! After using is 5x/day for the first few days, I notice the tension begin to leave my body. I noticed the never ending to-do list swirling in my mind had stopped. I’m no longer consumed by everything I have to do and the weight of responsibilities, instead I have this deep inner knowing that everything will get done on time and I don’t have to rush. My husband has even commented on how much more calm and relaxed I am! 1 2"

Game Changer is definitely one of my favorite lines! The very first thing I tried from Lotus Wei was Infinite Love mist back in 2015, which I thought was great but sort of forgot about once I ran out of it. The next time I came back to Lotus Wei was when I purchased Game Changer mist in 2018, and it was exactly that- it showed me just how powerful flower essences can be sometimes. But again, once I ran out, I ended up taking a little break. Since 2019, though, I have generally been more consistently using flower essences & I've realized that Game Changer really resonates with me! When I used it in 2018, the effect was different from what I've experienced in more recent times. Back then, it seemed to help me organize & pull everything together in ways that allowed me to complete whatever I needed to complete. I was expecting it to do the same thing again, but now I've noticed that it's working on deeper levels; it seems to help me rejuvenate and relax, so that I no longer have cycles of burnout. It's showing me the importance of rest & how that contributes to accomplishment in the long run. Such an amazing & beautiful blend! B Beth ylang ylang goodness I love the scent- the blend that features ylang ylang is one of my favorites from Lotus Wei and the serum feels good on my skin. I also love this blend for supporting me through shifts in my life. S SproutGirl Subtle Yet Amazing I had this ordered through a local spa that carries the whole line. I've been eyeing this particular blend for a while but I wasn't sure if I wanted a serum, an elixir or a spray. I'm so glad I got the serum. It has a very subtle earthy smell that isn't overpowering. I love using it when I do my facial Gua Sha at home. It totally slows me down and relaxes me yet I also find myself easily doing things I need to do but with a sense of ease. I also like to put a drop behind my ears or rub it into my chest. I really love the subtle changes I feel when I'm using this and it's great to rub a little on just before doing the Game Changer meditation. Is it me or I feel like this helps me to remember things more in an embodied way. Love it!"

Wow! My mentor and business partner swore by Lotuswei Flower Essences so I knew I had to give them a try. Game Changer was my first and wow! my creativity exploded- the ideas flooded in and we are on tract to build a success Youtube channel with ideas and plans that came to me during my time of taking the essence! I absolutely recommend giving this a try and any of the other essences you have your eye on ✨🌸 Wow! Love hearing how Game Changer sparked your creativity! A A.S. A True GameChanger I started on the combo of elixirs as there were specific flowers from each collection - stabilization level 1, exploration level 2, and expansion level 3 - with which I identified. So, to follow the concept of verticalization Katie Heiss explained at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNQVAi_CaB4 with the help of a consultant we corresponded each essence with its next level.  So, I am the following using elixirs,  mists, anointing oils and bath salts: Inspired Action Level 1, GameChanger Level 2, and Inner Knowing Level 3. I am not only way more focused and objective but where I noted a profound change is with GameChanger and how it completely reset my priorities and freed me from extremes. I identified ""time-wasters"" in people, and their intentions which resulted in swiftly and peacefully cutting those away to give space for effective use of my time. I was involving myself with other's people's lives and their actions,  gossiping about them and consuming myself with unproductive and toxic behavior. I cut all of that away after the third week of taking GameChanger and filled that ""void"" with activities that brought laser focus on my priorities and irreversible momentum which amplified my conscious change. J J.g. Speechless I'm a lawyer who just transitioned to a more intense area of practice. I've never been adept at ""faking it till I make it,"" and I knew I would have to fake the funk for now so my adversaries don't eat me alive in open court. I've been taking this elixir right before negotiations with opposing counsel or difficult calls with clients and the results have been breathtaking. It doesn't feel like the elixir adds any particular qualities to me, but rather it completely removes all the self-doubt and meekness, which has until now been my default programming. It's been only a week and I've received several compliments on my poise and effectiveness during situations where the old me would've fallen apart. This elixir has also been an incredible aid in my writing; I feel more creative and focused and I'm no longer wrestling with writer's block. If you're looking for massive instant growth in your career, give this a try if you feel called to. Thank you to the team at Lotuswei. K K.B. Works Every Time Yes! When you need a gentle nudge to expand beyond your current situation, Gamechanger is for you. I would've been happy if nothing externally shifted and I only felt the accompanying capacity to handle life with grace. Indeed, faced with mountains, I gradually became less overwhelmed, more organized, slept better, at ease with ""what is,"" and more spacious. But my externaly life shifted as well - opportunities opened up, invitations for a more coherent life arrived, time expanded allowing creative solutions to show up... None of it was painful. None of it triggered my nervous system. It all just unfolded naturally. Both times, a few years apart, although the second time felt less stuck as I'd already been shown the way. Like I said... gentle shifts. B Beth F. Perfectly named This formula is most certainly a game changer. I can feel the shifts. I have more focus. I tend to get overwhelmed easily and feel like there's never enough time in the day. Game changer is so effective for me because it not only helps me relax into real time, but  in doing that I have been able to get really clear and prioritize in an entirely new way. Thank you!!! N Natasha P.v.W. Certainly a GameChanger! I was fired into meaningful action with this flower essence blend. For a long time I had been wanting to clear my space to where it feels beautiful and light and open again. With this elixir, I was able to stay motivated, work through overwhelm and even gain clarity into my core values, which has been helpful continuing on this path of clarity and simplicity. E Elizabeth H. support for life shifts This is my favorite elixir blend, especially when used in combination with the Gamechanger serum, anointing oil and spray. It’s one of my favorite scents and it feels like such a support for any life shifts, however big or small. S Sara F. GameChanger: What a great name! I have really found this elixir to be powerful, so much so that I bought the serum too.  I feel that this whole time in our world is centered around changing the game and I want to be a part of that!  I am so glad to have the product to support that.  Even just taking it and looking at the name in the morning reminds me that today is going to be different and we are part of a big shift.  I love GameChanger products!  Thanks Lotus Wei! I Isabelle E. completely realigned and cleared out my home !! so i bought this alongside inspired action, intending to use both to get a lot of work done around my career and daily habits. intuitively i was drawn to use the game changer first. I think the first week a healing crisis of sorts was initiated. a lot of issues (that I've had my entire life) seemed to but their head to the surface in the most uncomfortable ways! I had extreme apathy and frustrations with my self coming up.... after the first week or so of clearing a lot of emotions I began just cleaning the hec out of my house and reorganizing all my spaces!! my basement had been so filled to the brim with unorganized stuff, my living room, closet, ect. all of these previously avoided spaces, i was cleaning out and turning them into an oasis!!! I'm so so happy about it! I also made some beautiful changes in my relationship that just feel like a breath of fresh air as well.  while this was not how I intended to use game changer, i'm absolutely positive these changes will catapult me into a beautiful new cycle. I've let go of a lot, I'm making so much space physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and i feel so invigorated! i know this space will be magnetizing beautiful new experiences as well! I'm at the very end of the bottle and will start taking inspired action so soon~ I'll buy another bottle of this afterwords because i don't think my work with this essence blend is done! A Ariel H. Like many of Lotus Wei's elixir's, this one gives a subtle but powerful push to get things done. For me, a procrastinator, it took away any kind of fear or anxiety blocking me from getting things done, and gave a push in the right direction. 1 2"

Not a full 4ml It smells lovely and it's healing but there's not a full 4ml.its already almost empty and it wasn't to the top when I purchaed it Hi Karley, I totally understand your concern! Our anointing oils actually come in a 5ml bottle, which we don’t fill completely as it causes leakage problems & causes the tops to become deformed. Because of the space left in the top of the bottle, the volume is 4ml for each anointing oil. I hope that’s helpful! E Elizabeth B. Abundance from every direction I started using Wild Abundance anointing oil about four weeks ago. After two weeks, a young friend who was in financial straits overcame pride and shame to ask me for a loan to tide him and his fiancée through the next couple of months. It was a fairly significant amount of money, and at first I thought, “Hmmm. Can I afford this?” But very quickly, I felt not just positive but almost joyful about being able to say yes to him. His gratitude brought tears to my eyes. Four weeks after starting to use While Abundance, just in the past few days, my work life has shifted from one loyal client who has tided me through the past four or five months to suddenly getting emails and calls practically every day from people asking for my help (I am a freelance editor). This month I will be billing the most I have in six months, possibly more. Abundance showing up from every direction. And I love the scent. It makes me happy. I am placing another order today! Thank you for sharing your incredible experience with Wild Abundance! We're so thrilled it's brought joy, opportunities, and a sense of abundance into your life! B Becca G. I can't get enough! I love the smell of abundance! The flowery essence makes me happy and the ritual of putting it on truly feels like I'm being anointed. The smell is strong, but I enjoy it and can't wait to try others. It just so happens (coincidence or Wild Abundance oil?) that business has been booming after a slump and continuing steadily. The oil, along with self-affirmations, is doing wonders. Wild Abundance does have that magnetic quality of attracting abundance & prosperity. ; ) Also, if you LOVE jasmine (the floral magic in Wild Abundance), Sacred Body, Sacred Heart & Sacred Awareness ALL feature jasmine as well. You can also check out this handy scent wheel we have: https://www.lotuswei.com/pages/lotuswei-scent-wheel (it's clickable.). N Nikki P. Love it! Aligning to abundance with ease It smells pleasant. a little different than I expected based on the description. The high fruity note was unexpected for me. I have been determined to align to abundance mindset and seeing $10,000 in my business bank account at all the times, covering business, travel, continuing education and help expenses. in addition to that, I am preparing to move out of my parent's beautiful home into my own and aligning to all that is possible and desired for me in this independence and abundance from within! I am also using other flower essences and I can see myself already having more joyful money easily coming into my bank accounts and supporting my expenses. I have easily earned more money than I did a year or two, this month. Thank you for your feedback! We are so happy to hear that our Wild Abundance Anointing Oil is helping you align to abundance with ease.  It's wonderful to hear that you're using it to manifest your desires, including financial abundance, and that you've already seen positive results. We wish you continued success on your journey. Thank you for choosing us! xoxo S Susan Smell Lovely Wild Abundance anointing oil smells lovely and it brightens the day. Mixed with Divine Within anointing oil it smells heavenly. Hey Susan! We are thrilled to hear that you are enjoying the lovely scent of our Wild Abundance anointing oil. It's wonderful to know that it helps brighten your day. We agree that when combined with our Divine Within anointing oil, the scent is truly heavenly. Thank you for sharing your experience with us. xoxo J Jo-Ann B. I just can't stand the smell! I can't use it enough to know if it does anything, it makes me queasy. Oh Jo-Ann, you're so close! We have two suggestions: one is to mist as far from your nose as you can - like on your feet - until this feeling passes. It very likely could be a healing crisis, which are typically short-lived. The mists have only natural essential oils that make the scent. If the feeling doesn't pass after a few days of use, then consider switching to the elixir. Since you are having a strong reaction to it, chances are that this flower combination holds some important gifts for you. The elixirs have no scent, and are taken either by mouth or diluted in any water, tea or beverage that you drink. Keep at it if you can, and let us know how it goes. J Jamie A. Uplifting and Inspiring I love this fragrance and feel very queenly anointing myself with this sacred scent. I’m using it with the Divine Timing Elixir and the Joy mist. It’s helping me to slow down, appreciate the present moment and bring joy into my heart. Namaste! K Kimberly Love, love, love this oil! A A.S. Grounding and Comforting LOTUSWEI came as a recommendation from my career coach. I purchased the anointing oil along with the elixir. Subtle transformation. It transposed me to a different reality. Calm, knowing an acute sense of hearing; as if I was listening with my heart instead of my head. I recover from frustration almost immediately. I connect with others more. Needless to say, the scent is amazing. Z Z.M. I’m so grateful my friend recommended me I try this . After looking at the website Wild Abundance kept calling out to me. I read through the description and I really liked all the good things it’s supposed to bring into your life. I bought the anointing oil , the elixir, and the mist and I use them everyday. Since day 1 I noticed a shift in the way I feel and most importantly I feel like I have attracted more opportunities into my life. I feel less doubtful and more confident with myself. I have the awareness that what’s meant for me will come to me with ease. 1 2 3"

It helps me focus during work and I love it any other time because it just feels grounding and calming. My husband noticed it on me and tried it and now he asks me to ""put some of that smell good stuff"" on his wrists before we go out! The elixir is great also. Love that it’s become a ritual for both of you—thank you for sharing this sweet moment with us! K K.A. Lives up to the name! I was feeling so stuck/stagnant that I even had doubts about this working, but I am totally blown away by this blend! Everything started moving and I have gotten so much done and everything feels so effortless and even enjoyable! I got a new computer, which I have been putting off and using as an excuse to not move forward with projects. I realized I said out loud one day that getting this computer has been a gamechanger! That's when I realized its working. I have taken my business to the next level and magnetized an amazing opportunity to make some of my dreams come true faster than I would have thought possible. I feel in the zone and bursting with ideas that I am actually making happen immediately. So blown away and grateful for this blend. It has transformed some deeply stuck patterns of resistance and fear of success and may be the most life changing blend I have used so far. Love the scent too, its earthy and exotic. Thank you Lotuswei  :) S Sharon F. Power Shifter! One of the most gorgeous scents I have encountered! Completely magical and transportive...really shifting you out of negative or autopilot energy into peaceful presence. I have been on a personal healing journey for a decade (and walking with others on theirs as a certified health coach for 4 years). I literally felt like I had tried everything, and I had made a lot of progress, but then the pandemic hit (I think I actually had the virus in March 2020), and I felt like I was back at square one in so many ways. A year later, in March 2021 I decided to do a ""home retreat"" for myself with this anointing oil + ""Self Heal"" elixir...and lots of meditation, journaling, etc. I actually used this oil every time I would meditate, and I instantly felt myself deeply drop in to ""change the game"" in how my day was going and how I was feeling. I set the intention to do it for 6-8 weeks, but it ended up more like 4 months! It was a powerful experience, led by these plants. I would highly recommend it for anyone who needs to change their inner ""current"" and/or outwardly how their lives are stuck and lacking direction or flow. Now I also love applying it as my ""perfume"" in the morning...it really gets my day started beautifully! A A.S. I love Gamechanger SO much. I love all the things by Lotus Wei, but Gamechanger is my stand-by, all time favorite.  The smell is simply the *best* and always puts me in a can-do-it kind of attitude.  When it runs out, and I start to notice patterns of procrastination and overthinking creep back in, I get great clarity on how impactful Gamechanger really is to my daily life. T Tricia S. Truly is a Game Changer I have been using both the aura mist and elixir for 3 weeks now and it has been life changing. I am so...much... more focused and procrastination is a thing of the past! I no longer worry about what I need to accomplish, I just get it done. T Tracie H. Game changer, indeed! Since I started using this I am much better at focusing on the tasks at hand and better able to redirect my actions when I notice myself getting off track. (Being able to recognize that I’m getting off track has also improved!) A Ashley S. As it says I used Gamechanger throughout medical school to help get me through the slog of the days/nights.  I recently went back to it partially because the scent is just divine, but also because I was craving a little pep.  I was noticing a lot of procrastination and putting things off, dread, and overthinking.  I've been using Game Changer again for 1 week now and it truly has lit the fire.  I'm feeling motivated and energized, even pre-menstrually, which is normally a time of low energy for me.  I'm so grateful for Lotus Wei and all the light they bring to the world!  I love supporting this beautiful company! M Myla B. Truly a Game Changer. The scent is fabulous...It's exotic and a bit smokey! Being in quarantine has been difficult and overwhelming but the Game Changer Anointing Oil has been quite beneficial during these hard times. I've only been using it for two days and I've already been observing improvements in myself. When thinking of difficult things, I feel less overwhelmed. I would recommend Game Changer to anyone who is drawn to it and its properties. E Elizabeth H. my favorite scent Game Changer is my favorite scent so far- for me, it's light and fresh but earthy at the same time. This is my go to scent for support while creating space for myself to settle and bring ease to my day. S Stephanie H. Unstoppable This one has a sultry smell and I love it! It has helped me to not get so balled up and tense. It has given me permission to cut myself (and others) some slack. It's helping me see that I am doing more than I thought I was, therefore helping me feel accomplished and unstoppable! I so got this! 1 2"

My go to before Animal Communication Sessions I have been using this elixir for years now as part of my prep for Telepathic Animal Communication appointment. I put some on my 3rd eye and crown then sip a few drops from a jar of water during sessions. Helps the reading stay on point. So honored it's part of your sacred practice! k k.s. Enhances flow in group activities I've used this elixir on group retreats, finding that it helps facilitate a sense of community, sharing and openness in these settings. Likewise, in group mediumship circles, I feel that this elixir enhances not only my own perception, but heightens the awareness of the whole field, spurring the whole group to interact with each other and the energies we invite in on a deeper, more profound level. It's one that I hope to always have on hand for such events. E Eveline A. Heart opening The change I felt from this elixir was not subtle. Even though I took this essence last year, I could still very clearly remember how this elixir helped me feel where my heart is. Until now, it has helped me be very aware of when my heart is closed and when it is opened. Gave me courage to connect with others through my heart. N Natalia J. Unexpected For about 2 years i noticed i have no patience when communicating with my 3 yo girl. I used to be able to hang out with her for hours. But i became tired and annoyed when she wanted to play. After about a week of this elixir i was surprised to notice that i can read her a book and not feel tired or annoyed. I dont feel like running away from her all the time. I feel patient. I didnt get this elixir to deal with this situation so it was a surprise to observe this unexpected change. I am very happy about it!!!! p patricia p. Taking this Elixir before Animal Communication sessions brings the readings to a whole new level! I have only been using Western Prairie Fringed Orchid Elixir for a little over a month and I must say, if you work in the field of Telepathic Communication, I HIGHLY recommend you order this immediately! I use as directed (5 drops 5x day) and I believe (and clients are confirming)  that my sessions are WAY more detailed AND expansive than before. Also, I just realized that I feel more inspired to work on my blogs and manuscript that I had been struggling to remain interested in. I have also been using LotusWei elixirs: Radiant Energy, Boundless Wisdom, Joy Juice, & Wild Abundance for 16 months now and they have definitely enhanced my mental and emotional outlook on my life in a very POSITIVE way :)"

This flower definitely has the feel of a comfortable pillow, something I can rest my head on. Thank you! C Charlene Feel divinely supported For unknown reasons, I saw the words of white columbine popping up in my inbox a couple of times in a few days. I took it as a sign to explore this flower elixir. It is a gentle elixir. It helped me to feel that everything is always okay and it does not matter what is going on in the world. Thank you! R Rose <3 This elixir feels like peace in a bottle.  It helped me see my inner resources and trust in life just a little bit more.  Thank you <3 A Anastasia Tham Gentle and uplifting This was the most gentle and uplifting elixir I'd ever taken. Growing up was tough because my mother was not a very nurturing person, and I'd specifically picked this elixir to help me with healing those wounds. I felt more joyful and also found the strength to support myself when my traumas were triggered. A Arcadia So Peaceful If I had to describe this elixir I would call it peaceful, calming, and supportive.  I find that it works well with others that I take such as Self-heal and Bamboo (two of my favorites).  At times I can get overwhelmed easily with my busy and stressful work schedule.  This elixir has been the perfect complement to help me slow down and not feel so agitated, it's like a big warm hug!  I now carry it with me daily to help lift me out of the doldrums when I start feeling stressed and panicky! 1 2"

Beautifully revealing This was a very interesting experience, I expected some darker aspects to arise, yet it revealed some insecurities and things deeper in my subconsciousness I wasn't fully aware of, definately transformative and I find there is a gentlness to it as well. J J.M. Learn A LOT about yourself in a short amount of time I second Mary Beth's comment about effortless insights! There is a gracefulness and clarity, though I also had moments of overwhelm/ onslaught of awareness if I was at work or otherwise occupied when the insights arose. It was fun and felt manageable, but for people with chaotic schedules, Inner Peace might be a good pair... to help ground your experience and bring more calmness/ stability to really integrate said insights. (: M Mary B.P. Insights just effortlessly arrive This elixir helps to uncover connections between present emotional states and past as well as present experiences with great rapidity. Great to pair with Truthteller to be honest with yourself. Also, love to pair it with white water lily when wanting to feel really in synchronization/understand others. A Anastasia T. Light in the shadows This elixir helped to illuminate my blind spots and the red flags I'd missed in my partner previously. Although they were painful to see, I saw what I needed and also the parts of my wounded self that were triggered. A Ariel H. I still have yet to finish this bottle, so I'll have to write another review once I finish it. I was drawn to this flower because of its beauty. What I thought was interesting, was that it made me face truths that I wasn't ready to face at the moment. Powerful! K Kristi L. Showing up for myself, full throttle!! I dove in head first with Sugarbowl. She invited me along for an energetically supercharged journey these past 3 weeks. The message I've received through this essence is to Show Up For Me. I've gone out into the world in full resonance with my values, my emotional authenticity, my sparkle-vibrance and gratitude. And what a journey it's been/being! I feel the next phase is to stay curious, keep playful in my rituals and keep exploring. Sugarbowl and Truth Teller has given me voice to articulate dreams I couldn't even have imagined a month ago: a medical billing/holistic bodywork center. To call tribe to me and create a women's hyper-modern quantum energetic shamanic singing ensemble. Approach everything from a boundless well of gratitude. There's nothing to hide!! 💖 E Eveline A. No more hiding Am on my second bottle, first bottle was taken sometime last year. With this second bottle, I find myself being more comfortable in being seen by others and putting myself out there. I have even posted a photo of myself on my social media platforms - a huge shift for me. I also find myself liking how I look too, not as critical of how I look but accepting and actually feel comfortable in my own skin."

S Sheri Reed New believer I was really skeptical, but decided to give it a go…it started feeling the difference in about 4 days…I don’t believe I was taking the full 5Xs a day just when I thought about it. I’m taking the Stream Orchid and Infinite Love.. I was driving home from errands and it just hit me… I was so relaxed and calm like I had just had a massage. Which I really wanted to have.. I now can have total relaxation when ever I need it …definitely a go to for me. I’m loving it!! L LM Wonderful I ordered this because I'm a musician/professional singer and also do voice over. I'm working on healing a little bit of vocal damage from a thyroid issue so I thought I'd give this a shot. It's been wonderful! I'm about 3 weeks in. I take it 5x a day and also before and after singing or voice over work. I notice that I don't feel any strain or fatigue. Will definitely order another bottle and want to check out more of the LotusWei offerings that aid the voice/5th chakra! Thank you! K Kris Wow! All I can say is wow! This elixir is amazing! It really helped me through a tough time after I had a bad sickness last year that affected my throat and vocal cords. I was almost to the point where I couldn’t speak and this elixir  turned it around and got my voice back to normal. I purchased this one along with several others and I kid you not, every time for about the first week of taking the elixir I would go to grab this elixir and it would fall/jump out of my hands each time! It didn’t happen with any of the other elixirs and I knew that I truly needed this one. It has worked so well for me and I’m so thankful for it!"

Wow! What a difference! I started using gamechanger a couple of weeks ago. I have been also doing meditation daily. My blood pressure has been fluctuating for over 2 years now and I’ve noticed that stress seems to really drive it up. Since I started using the gamechanger set, I have noticed it slowly coming down but it’s probably due to feeling more relaxed and at ease with delegating tasks. Today is Thanksgiving. I have a house full of wonderful family visiting complete with their pets. This is the first year that I have actually felt like there really is no need to rush, meeting and adapting to everyones schedules has been a breeze. This morning I actually sat for nearly 2 hours and just enjoyed laughing and talking with everyone. I was the first one up after a restful nights sleep and was able to sit and sip my tea and watch how the energy changed as each person woke up and made their way to the kitchen and family room areas. Wow!!! How wonderfully has this set of flower essences affected me! I’m grateful for the Lotuswei team and the changes that you have helped me make in my life! C Corley M. Lifted Weight Off My Shoulders First off, I adored the scent of these.  It was beautiful.  I kept smelling my wrists all day.  It felt expansive and grounding. I loved this set and highly recommend the kit.  I began it while feeling very overwhelmed and stagnant.  My house was a mess.  I was flooded with excellent ideas for a new project but overwhelmed and anxious at the thought of how I might accomplish them and felt stuck and buried under the longest to do list.  Getting to it felt so aversive and heavy. I felt like my “healing crisis” was slightly longer then all of a sudden, my I got so much done and cleared.  I didn’t have the heaviness and feeling of avoidance but just jumped into them with joy.  I wasn’t getting overwhelmed by EVERYTHING I had to do but instead had a sense of prioritizing and completed with focus the most important tasks with ease.  I felt like I became way more efficient.  I felt like my list was complete.  I felt like I could breathe with things on my list.  And I felt ok to take a break and not do any of it on some days.  This was wonderful to take and I loved having the set. A Amanda M. Cannot believe it!! I'm really shocked by the way the True Change set has affected me. I'm currently at a time in my life where I'm going through a major transition and personal upgrade and felt I could use support and really allow positive change to come through instead of back down and just a week and a half in I feel like a new person. As a mother of two with a full-time job and own separate career path I'm no stranger to stress, but it's really hit me in the past week how EASY everything feels. I'm somehow able to actually prioritize things, get then done and when work is done it's done. I usually feel like a chicken with my head cut off, and I'm notoriously disorganized but I'm been able to rest more deeply than I ever have and also accomplish more throughout my day. I've also had some amazing opportunities come out of nowhere and I'm embracing them. Less is truly more sometimes!"

I took the flower quiz and got matched with Boundless wisdom. I think it is a great match for me. I love adding this to my water, coffee, and tea all day. I can tell the difference on days I forget to add. Would definitely recommend!! Wonderful thank you Jen! xo R Rhonda Brings me back to stillness. My nature. Focus on my intuitive sense. Hello Rhonda! Super appreciate your feedback on Boundless Wisdom :) We are happy it is helping to bring you back to your nature! xoxo J Jenny C. lifesaver I was going through a tough time having my father gone into emergency and getting treatment everyday while in hospital.  Since he has been released back home recently, the whole family has constantly been concentrating on his care (from regular monitoring, organising medicines dosages, communicating with medical teams who have been visiting us over the past few months and will do so in future, transporting to appointments at clinics and other facilities).  I admit that this was one of the most challenging times I had to face, especially when the pandemic is still not over yet and I also have health issues myself. I just needed something to help me through this as I have a nervous disposition with low self esteem when it comes to learning new things.  The email being sent to me about traumatic events being witnessed by Taylor and how emotions can be overcome with the Boundless Wisdom flower essence came at the right time when I was feeling so insecure.  I tried the elixir and mist gradually, not expecting anything to happen but after few days to a few weeks, I was very surprised that my coping mechanism is working smoothly!  With all the things I had been taught in a short time by the medical professionals to help me care for my father, I was taken back with how well I conducted myself.  Even those who know me well, were praising me for being brave.  They could not have done what I did. Boundless Wisdom is a must for those who are having a traumatic time because it really does bring out the best of your ability to face things you never believed you can but it will and that it is reassuring that it is okay to be vulnerable and strong at the same time. Hey Pei! Hoping your father is doing better now, and we are touched reading your experience of Boundless Wisdom :) So, so happy it has helped you navigate the difficult time. Grateful that Taylor's email came just when you needed it! xoxo S Stacy h.C.

Thank you so much ~ so thankful you have felt such a profound experience! Xoxo L L.P. Like being hugged by an angel I honestly don’t know how I would have made it through these covid years without Boundless Wisdom. Each time I take it I feel my heart settle and expand both inwards and outwards into a space of pure loving awareness. I feel safe, held and guided. It’s truly as if I’m being hugged by an angel. Thank you so much! A Anonymous Boundless wisdom Great elixer! I have felt more instinctively aware of situations and how I can best weather any storm. I am more peaceful, thoughtful and happier! Highly recommend Barby S Susan Needed This One I was drawn to Boundless Wisdom a few weeks ago. I needed an added boost to my routine of regularly taking Radiant Energy as my grounding elixir. I needed to increase my spiritual awareness. I wanted to be more in sync with the present moment and not so overwhelmed by people's traumas.  It worked! Boundless Wisdom helped me stay centered and aware. When the demands of work get overwhelming this elixir keeps me aware of the present moment and able to cope with the daily demands in my life. L Lisa M. Peace Wow, I love this blend so much. In the past few months, I ended my relationship, my grandmother passed and I'm moving to a new city. It's helping me find surrender and learning to let go. I feel peaceful and my grief feels like it has a space but isn't overpowering. I've also gained new insights about things I've been previously resentful about. Beautiful beautiful. Thank you from my full heart! A Anonymous Wisdom Gave me a new perspective that felt right on something that I have been struggling with. O Oana A.T. Mindful awareness It is a wonderful elixir and a great support while Mercury is retrograde🤭 . It does help me detach from overthinking and step back into my fully aware self and discern better between fears, attachments and what is actually happening around me and helps me tap more into my loving and compassionate side. For me it works as described and even better than I expected. I will definitely repurchase this elixir. Thank you 😊 1 2"

Fabulous! Boundless Wisdom makes me smile every time I use it, which is at least 5 times a day, along with Truth Teller and Divine Within.  I look forward to gathering the whole collection, as the impact on my whole being is intensely palpable - I feel bathed in the beauty of the flowers - grounded, lifted, inspired and transformed.  Pure magic!  Thank you, Katie! N Nikki R. Yes Wholesome and fulfilling. The wisdom is truly boundless. Thank you. Thank you for your kind words! N Natalie C. YES! To everything Boundless Wisdom is meant for <3 First of all, I wanted to bathe in this new flower energy! The fragrance is so inviting and beautiful. Seeking deeper connection to the Lord Jesus has been my quest for some months now and this has added richly to my awareness of His voice by helping me break through old brain patterns (He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him <3) About a week in, I transitioned to Infinite Love and that has been quite the journey. I look forward to returning to Boundless Wisdom. If you're on the fence about trying BW, climb all the way over and give it go. I think you will be glad you made that choice. Thank you for taking the time to leave such a wonderful review of our Boundless Wisdom Mist! We are so glad to hear that you have found it helpful in your spiritual journey and that it has aided in your connection with the Lord Jesus. We hope that you continue to enjoy the new flower energy :) Thank you for choosing Boundless Wisdom, Natalie! xoxo C Corley M. Support with Grief for Family I purchased this after our family dog unexpectedly died in difficult circumstances.  My other dog, children, husband and I were struggling with shock, grief, and finding meaning. I used this mist on us all, spritzed it in my kids water bottles and on my dog.  It helped to ease the heartache and helped us move on and find meaning in peace with the circumstances and loss. Very supportive spray for transitions or loss. C Christy C. Boundless Wisdom I am a self-admitted essential oil, floral essence and herbal snob.  I did not expect this to be a very impactful product, but wanted to give it a try based on others reviews and ratings.  I was so wrong.  This brand is so unique and has done an amazing job at creating a quality product. I really love this scent, but also how I can feel it transforming my energy.  I spray it on my face and throat and chest.  I inhale deeply, and a sense of peace and calm and determination comes over me.  I am excited to try more blends. Hey Christy! Thank you so, so much for your wonderful feedback. So glad you are feeling the transformative qualities!

Most needed I need this essence for myself and my sweet pup Lily. It is the best thing for both of us. D D.B. Didn't think I needed this but wow! I got this as part of the flower evolution program, I wouldn't necessarily have bought it at the time, because I'm generally really connected and tapped in spiritually, surrendered, spend a lot of time in refective space etc., but I'm so glad I got to try it, it suprised me! I'm doing a lot of healing work and this helped open my vision even more to see things better, also when I work with others, helped to reveal things more clearly... plus helped feeling more at ease in general, so I also use it when I need that, or when I feel the need to let of something, it's been wonderful support! K K.H. A moment in nature Boundless Love, along with Infinite Love, is my absolute favorite. Somehow it makes me very connected to nature, which also feels like love and groundedness. I do think that when we are grounded and connected to nature and to our true self, we have access to  the wisdom and intuition that is always there but that we forget how to connect with or listen to. R R.B. Cuts through the confusion This mist is great when you are need of clarity of understanding what you are going through especially through self healing. It also helps you just be at peace and centered through the a crisis C Catherine Relaxing The Boundless Wisdom mist helped me to be more relax and to really pause and enjoy each moment. I sprayed the mist around my head and my shoulder many times a day. I’m so happy with this purchase and I cannot wait to try all of them. I can say that this made a big impact on my well being.

Incredible Essence I am grateful for the opportunity. Been using all three. I find myself enjoying the essence mist,  the flower elixir and the anointing oil. I have not fasted in several years. I decided to do a light fast 5 days a week throughout this December. And added meditation and getting some sunshine most mornings. Looking forward to entering the New Year❣️I love it. Your kind words mean the world to us! J J.G. The scent is amazing I buy this oil because it is a smell my nose craves, I don't know how else to explain it. I have never encountered anything else like it - it just makes me feel good when I breathe it in! p parisa m. It's all okay Was a lovely earthy scent! It had a calming subtle undertone to it which I noticed as I was using it, a feeling that everything was all okay. Really lovely supportive blend. L L.C. New Levels of Spirituality Since I've been using this oil over the last month, I've seen new levels of growth in my spirituality and intuitive gifts. I'm definitely operating from a higher state of consciousness and I think this oil was a helpful tool in my toolbox to get me there. Thank you! K Kaitlyn L. Boundless Wisdom A beautiful essence that is both grounding and expansive, awakening our own inner divinity and sacred wisdom. C Coleen C. Blissfully connected This essence is glorious! I use it regularly when I am feeling scattered and I find that it helps me to reconnect and center. A Anonymous Amazing I took the flower quiz and it led me to boundless wisdom.  This is the most beautiful scent I have ever encountered.  The high note for me is rose but I definitely smell the other flower essences like lilac and magnolia.  I apply it to my chakras and it calms and centers me bringing me into the divine present moment.  Love this!  I only wish it came in a larger bottle. J Jeanne-Marie M. Magical + grounded presence This blend makes me feel like a fairy. It's a huge support to noticing and being with what is, releasing what doesn't serve me, and letting myself move where there's flow. It really does smell like a walk in the woods. Light and fresh, yet earthy and makes me feel a sense of oneness with the now. I love rubbing the oil on my wrists and inhaling deeply against my nose. Thank you for this gift <3 L Lisa M. A new favorite Another wonderful product from Lotus Wei. Using this with Penstemon in the FLOWEREVOLUTION program. It's just exquisite, the smell, the oils and the flowers. And amethyst! Incredible. M Monica Peaceful Blend I feel really connected to the Bodhi tree, specially during times of emotional distress, or fear. Using this oil has really helped me to feel at peace, and it has become an essential part of my meditation practice. 1 2"

Raising consciousness My goals this month were focused on raising my spiritual consciousness level, as calibrated by Dr. David Hawkins. (""Power vs Force""). At starting point, I  calibrated at 528. Today, a month later,  I calibrated at 605. It's interesting to me that I can still exhibit low level behaviors. What seems to be the case is that I have a base I generally operate on, and return to. I seem to process irritation quickly and remember there is space for other people to be who and what they are. The use of this blend in conjunction with my usual spiritual routine has been gentle realizations and thrilling insights. I feel like the moon, in peaceful fullness. I feel safe in an elevated internal place when challenged. I feel excited to see what new realizations come to me as I continue to work with this blend another round. E Eveline A. Value for money I thought this set was value for money since you get three this blend in three different forms. As a blend, it helped see me through a very difficult period of time in my life."

Inspired Action is my go-to throughout the day for maintaining focus throughout the day and getting things done. Full Bloom is a very powerful blend I have also taken in elixir form that helps me embody my fullest self. Quiet Mind + Inner Peace are wonderful for winding down and sleeping soundly. I love to use Boundless Wisdom for meditation and personal reflection/growth. And Truthteller (maybe my favorite smell) is a magical blend that helps me express myself in a way that feels authentic. They all smell divine too! And I love that they are so portable and great for travel—another reason I got them was to share with others when I'm on the go and spread the flower essence love :-) Will be definitely be ordering some of these in a larger size after I run out! d dariya z. beautiful collection It was the best being able to try all of these and they were all so great. I wasn't sure whether to go with Boom or Embody mists, but am glad I chose Boom first: they're all so different, but generally feel fresh and comforting. It's they're all saying ""wake up!"" in their unique ways. And it was fun noticing which ones I gravitated to more on different days. At first, I used Truthteller the most. Then I added Full Bloom (now my favourite!), Boundless Wisdom, and Inner Peace. A few weeks later, I starting using Quiet Mind every morning and night. I had this whole collection in my purse at work and would use it to rejuvenate and feel more playful + supported during the day. Inspired Action was the one it took about a month to warm up to - but now, I am using it more and more. I used all these along with the Clock Vine Elixir, and then the White Columbine and Cannonball Elixirs. So this Boom collection lasted me about 2 months! I did use some mists regularly, some less regularly. But I loved how I started to just tell the truth more easily (to myself and others), sleep more easily, feel more powerful, and like I can handle things moving forward. I love how subtle the changes are. I don't even notice sometimes, until I'm doing the thing that used to be difficult...change comes with ease. Would love to reorder these in the future. Especially wish I could get some more Truthteller - though they're all wonderful! Hi Dasha! Truthteller is now available in all modalities! :D"

Everything from the energy shift to the essential oil based scents and the aesthetic packaging. So thoughtful, lovely and soothing. I will be using these products for myself as well as with clients. L Libby B. Great Intro to Flower Essences I bought this set along with the game changer elixir when I first started working with flower essences and I LOVE it! It’s a great way to introduce yourself to the different mixes. I really enjoy mixing and matching the different sprays depending on how I feel at that particular point in the day. E Eveline A. Christmas Gifts This set is value for money and a good stocking-filler! Gave most of them to friends and family over Christmas last year, but kept Joy Juice to myself. These Aura Mists came in small 30 ml plastic spray bottles, which makes them easy to carry around and a good way to smell-test each different blends LotusWei has! K Kitty Shelf life What is the shelf life of your product Hi Kitty! As long as they are kept away from extreme heat and direct sunlight, the shelf-life of the products is several years. How is this possible? We use natural preservatives: Elixirs (organic alcohol is a natural preservative), Anointing Oils (organic jojoba oil base is extremely shelf stable), Serums + Body Oils (vitamin E as natural preservative). The Mists are shelf stable for one year!"

One that I'll come back to as I continue working with the essence. I think it makes a huge difference to dive into the topic and learn about the flowers. More teachings please and thank you <3 C CM Must purchase this! This was the most refreshing and beautiful perspective on magnetizing abundance and beauty I have yet to encounter.  The teaching was beautiful, soft, lovely, and really shifted some long held perspectives and patterns.  I highly recommend purchasing this.  It is a beautiful, earth inspired, yin and feminine perspective on this subject which is so very much needed.  I plan to purchase any available teachings that correspond elixirs I’m using in future! D Dionne A Gentle Reminder of Abundance I really enjoyed taking this teaching.  As I engaged with my second bottle of the Wild Abundance elixir, this playshop (because it definitely did not feel like work!) deepened my connection to the myriad ways abundance shows up in my life and how I limit my perception of abundance for various reasons.  As a result I've been able to 'catch' myself slipping into my default patterning quicker and I've been able to gently redirect myself."

Really helpful for stressful situations I started using these mists a couple of weeks ago and I'm already feeling a difference! Right now I'm focusing on Quiet Mind, which has definitely helped with my neck tension and to relieve stress whenever I am feeling overwhelmed. I can't wait to dive more deeply into the other two! So glad you're feeling the difference already! J JACQUELINE M.

I also had a tiny bit of the  Luscious Embodiment spray left. A wonderful vibrant energy and I added some Camelia flower water. Which made it very soothing. I love all your sprays! R Robyn R. Aaaah! This package is a great way to try the three mists. I like the scent of all three, and use them for calming stress and for relaxation."

This blend resonates with me on a deep level. It feels like something I truly need. Over the years, I've always gotten Infinite Love on the quiz & that's definitely a great one for me too. Full Bloom, though, really is the key to unlocking what it is that I've been searching for; it gifts you with lost/hidden magic, beauty, power & blessings. It's very difficult to explain, but so incredible. I feel like Full Bloom almost flies under the radar and gets bypassed in comparison to the other blends, which is not a coincidence; that is what its energy is all about (helping you access things that seem to have disappeared). Ugh I love it so much!! A must-have! L Libby Obsessed With This Scent! Oh my goodness, I am truly in LOVE with the smell of these bath salts! I had been interested in trying Full Bloom but wasn't sure how I was going to feel about the smell and I was already working with Expansive Presence Elixir so this was a great way to sort of dip my toe into the Full Bloom Experience. The smell is so invigorating and does wonders for clearing your head. I'm not one to take long baths so instead, I mix some of the salt in with coconut oil and use it as a scrub. And I also found it worked great when I sprinkled it in my shower loofa with my fav lemon body wash. There are just so many ways to work with this intoxicating scrub. I'm definitely going to try out the anointing oil next so I can use it daily and really get a feel for the energetic shifts it provides in addition to just smelling great. Once again, LotusWei, you've outdone yourself and I couldn't be happier! M Monica Happy and Joyful Blend! This blend is a perfect way to relax after a long day. It's citrusy and sweet scent make me happy and joyful. I can definitely feel the flower essences of this blend, they make me feel expansive, creative, and full of joy. M Monica Divine and Joyful Scent! The Full Bloom bath salts are such a beautiful way to relax after a long day. This blend feels very energizing and reminds me of a beautiful summer day."

I took a bath tonight in the Joy Juice bath salt and it was the best bath of my life. (I'm super into baths, too!) This was my first experience with Joy Juice and now I'm hooked. Wonderfully paired with the meditation. It felt like enormous gentle waves of my true joyful nature unfolding within me and allowed me to very easily release all of the energies within me that were blocking my true joyful self. I was giggling and grinning. Incredible. Thank you so much! <3 D Devon C.K. BATHS ARE MY FAVORITE Lotus Wei Baths are my favorite way to use Lotus Wei blends. Knocking a star for the content weight (more per package please!) Joy Juice has my favorite scent. Spicy Jasmine?

I don't know if I've gotten the effects as flower essences work as energy healing for me so whatever I do in the present doesn't have an effect for some time. I'm looking forward to more joy in my life!"

Excellent Does exactly what it's meant to do! E E.L. A special blend! I decided to get this blend, so I can be more open and honest in my expression and communication, especially with myself. I have the habit of noticing the truth but  tend to keep it to myself,  thinking no one would understand. I tend to try to fix what I see and in the process I seem to attempt to funnel the  whole truth through my own perspective. This elixir has helped me find wisdom and patience in the truth telling process.  It has been a wonderful support in witnessing and  naming old programming and patterns  that no longer work. One is that the Truth is often a paradox and I can be more fluid in my understandings and communication. Another is  that the Truth needs to be witnessed and acknowledged  first, before it's even spoken out loud. and just the subtle act of speaking it to oneself can have a profound effect on the dynamics of any situations! Definitely and magical and special elixir M Merlin K. Favorite elixir so far! I was reading some of the comments down below and I agree with some of the writers in that I have a tendency to hold my tongue and keep my thoughts to myself. I find that taking this elixir has helped me open up at work a lot more and advocate for my patients a lot more or even risk asking the ""stupid question"". My attitude is more geared towards gaining knowledge versus worrying about my ego getting bruised. Also I have been singing more. I used to sing, but then a person in my life took the joy out of singing and music from me, but now I am okay with my music choices and sharing them and also singing whatever tunes I fancy :) I think I might keep buying this elixir, it brings my inner child out, I remember being a chatty brat growing up until life and people got to me ;) T Tiffani S. Just wow! I have a tendency to hold my tongue and it causes me a good amount of turmoil and anxiety/depression. I was able to finally have some really tough conversations and I felt the clarity and confidence I needed to speak my mind in an authentic and compassionate manner. Just ordered another bottle until I feel like I can continue to speak up on my own. A Ashley L. Definitely helping me speak my Truth WOW! Speaking my Truth has been a lifelong challenge for me, but I finally decided it was time to work through that so I ordered this elixir and it definitely opened me up! I advocate for myself now, and engage in vulnerable conversations that I would've previously avoided. I especially appreciate how taking this elixir has led me to situations where I can see and experience its benefits. It feels like it's giving me opportunities and encouragement to practice using my voice, which while still scary sometimes, is also greatly appreciated. If you struggle with authentic communication, I definitely recommend this elixir! E Erin B. Great for stepping into leadership roles I found this really helped me tackle difficult conversations at work with more confidence and authenticity. I was able to embrace some leaderships qualities around having hard conversations and being able to speak up in meetings and share my perspective in ways I struggled to do before. I can't wait to pair this with the new Expansive Presence to help me more fully move into the areas of leadership I am aiming for in my career. K Kristen M. Amazing elixir! This elixir helped me through a time when I was really struggling to say what I wanted for fear of being judged. I was around some very bold and judgmental people who would put me down for everything I believed that was different from them. It was like it was a huge deal for me to hold a different opinion than them. I had never experienced that before in my life and was very taken back by it. I felt like I had to agree with them on everything just to avoid arguing. I found this elixir and was drawn to it instantly. It really helped me find my voice and to be heard instead of judged. A Avon Found my truth It does exactly what it says. I am able to speak my truth. I was a alcoholic for most of my life. This helped me put my truth out into the world to help others. Something I would have been to scared to do in the past. I can also speak up if I feel someone has wronged me. Thank you for this wonderful gift. R Rocio U. Amazing! This Elixir is amazing! I have noticed l feel more confidence and confiable speaking up, l was struggling to express my self my message was not clear, l now l notice my words flow direct and precise! I really love this elixir this was the first one l bought and definitely came back for more ! A April S.G. Freedom This helped dissolve fears around singing in public. It opened me to fearless truth speaking. Throat chakra felt open, free, and brave while loving and aware of speaking from compassion. I was acutely aware that listening is an important part of communication. 1 2"

Magnificent articulation When I first used this blend, almost immediately the thoughts that had been swirling around in my head for weeks had clarified and were ready to be articulated. I had a very vulnerable conversation that night, and felt so relieved afterwards. The magic of this blend, for me, is in transforming my harder-to-articulate feelings and thoughts into words that can express my sentiments and allow me to move on and move forward.

Motivation Wasn't sure what to expect from my first mist, but have been so pleased and truly surprised..

My son is a Gestalt learner and we have had a difficult time understanding the way he communicates. It’s heartbreaking to witness him desperately trying to communicate and break down when he is not understood. I started giving him truth teller 2 weeks ago and I can’t believe how much clearer he is already communicating. The words are flowing out and he is speaking more and clearer than we have ever heard! He is also calmer and happier because he is able to communicate simple concepts without resistance. I’m feeling relieved and grateful. I’m amazed. Thank you! We are delighted to hear how much Truthteller has supported your son :) C Corley M. Liberating Voice I have felt that my throat chakra and my capacity to speak for myself and speak truth for the sake of speaking truth has been challenged and blocked.  In addition to a feeling that this energy centre has been blocked, I have had a history of neck tension, injury and pain.  Therefore, I decided to deviate from my preferred method of taking elixir and try the serum.  My routine is to massage my neck and throat with the serum while stating my intention. I haven’t felt any neck tension.  In the past, I had great anxiety about expressing truth.  I feel this has greatly changed.  I have been engaging with politicians in emails and meetings, expressing concerns and stating truth, and that which I’ve needed to say in personal relationships has come out with ease.  I feel the serum has supported my intentions to communicate effectively and respectfully for highest good. Using the serum is a grounding experience.  Using it anchors my attention in my physical body and in the present moment through the sensation of touch.  The serum is light, absorbs quickly and the scent is refreshing.  I highly recommend it. d diana a. Genuine speech that sprouts from within I remember getting the lip balm made under the same name a couple of years ago with great results. When I saw the serum was on sale on the website, I decided to give it a try,  in hopes for equal results. The smell is lovely, and very unique. After a few days of wearing it, I have become more upfront in my speech. I have had conversations with people I have hold off for years! I am writing in my journal, and the words come out way more easily. Also, I recently had a very successful interview with the dean of my program at university, and it all flowed quite easily. I was genuine and authentic, but the conversation that transpired was smart and the words I used were eloquent. If you have or have suffered from throat Chandra problems, give this is a try. It has helped me just after a few days of wearing it. I am sure the results will continue to unfold in a wonderful manner."

The smell is amazing and it’s now become a part of my process when getting ready to give a reading. I place a little on my throat and envision my throat chakra opening, expanding, and balancing. It’s so soothing and works like a charm! I’ve been finding it easier to just deliver the intuitive information I receive without questioning myself. I even bought a rollerball necklace so I can carry this oil around with me at all times and I’m getting ready to order my 2nd bottle.

I love the way they gradually unfurl, and that they are the first plants to emerge even in inhospitable conditions. ( like growth on volcanic rock) I feel like I am fern energy!  Slow but tenacious 😜 Since using Eagle Fern, I have noticed that I am able to stand more calmly while expressing myself . I am less fearful of being rejected or ridiculed. I keep it simple ( like fern) and let things unfold with less fear. I am the otherworldly project that is unfolding 😁. I’ll probably return to this one again. C Celeste I finished off eagle fern as I was defending my thesis. It seemed to help with easing my anxiety in terms of expectations. I felt more open to the experience, versus worrying about what to expect/how things would work out. As promised, it helped me be more open and flexible to life unfolding K Kristi Lee Unfolding from within the unknown I started my journey with Eagle Fern in early March as the tremors of change were first beginning to appear in my world. Even as I was recognizing that huge patterns and worldviews I took for granted were collapsing in on themselves, Eagle Fern under my tongue reminded me that things were always in a state of flux. Now I could really be present for it, and continue to be a witness to my own unfolding of where I might go on my spiritual journey. It provided a low smouldering of intention that was the perfect segue to transition into a journey with White Magnolia. I wasn't ready for the practice to be over with Eagle Fern, so I have another elixir to travel with in another month or two. I was in a constant period of new awakenings, and Eagle Fern beat a low drumbeat of, ""You have the answers."" L Laura Light and trust Such an interesting elixer. I’m on my second bottle. Overall, I feel much lighter, open and trusting. It seems to have cleansed some old gunk and also don’t feel any type of control or worry. I really don’t have a sense of what is unfolding, though feels like eagle fern has helped me to “get out of my own way”  and to allow something bigger to unfold. A very special one. Thank you! HOW BEAUTIFUL! I am so happy you are resonating so well with Eagle Fern!"

I love working with Venus Flytrap. She has an electric sizzle to her that is centering and also aligning, I can feel the intention and path building. My intuition and awareness of timing has been heightened. Also absolutely love the meditation Lotus Wei has in conjunction with her. D Daniela Curious- I've been taking Venus Flytrap for 2 weeks. I feel like it's working on subtle ways, like I wait for the right moment to snap in action. I see clearer what I need to change and want in the next phase, wait for the right situation to come.  I'll keep you all updated on what unfolds. I Isabelle Ennis zest! snap! attraction! wow! i have been taking venus fly trap for about 2 weeks now (almost 3, but the first week i was using it more on and off) , and I'm noticing some amazing changes arising already! it's strange to explain, but even just the taste of it is somehow electric? i really love it. I'm noticing that i'm doing certain things very instinctively that I would've pondered over/ waited out a bit before. There is the sense of deep knowing that the new confidence stems from. I feel literally more attractive, not in the sense that i physically look different but my energy just feels more mesmerizing and literally ""attract""-ing like i can pull more towards me instead of forcing anything, or going out of my way to get things done. It seems like the energy I have is used more efficiently overall. I either make the changes and decisions i need to with swiftness, or attract other useful scenarios. I did an extensive tarot reading with venus when it arrived/ when i first took, to see how the energy would play out over time with it, what types of lessons would occur etc. To summarize, the cards showed that I should use venus pretty long term. Like 5 or 6 months. I wasn't expecting that but I just reordered 2 more bottles. With other flower essences and lotus wei products I've never felt called to take 1 essence that extensively!! I'm not completely surprised though because i felt oooo so attracted to venus when i first saw. Anyways I'll continually update progress here, I'm sure it will be interesting to see what unfolds! Really grateful to have access to this! S Stephanie Where has this been all my life?! Since taking the Venus Fly Trap elixir, I have started taking Reiki classes, started a daily yoga routine that I have kept up with, and made phone calls that I was dreading and had been putting off. This one is like combining the energy of Radiant Energy and the action taking from Inspired Action; with a hint of electricity that fuels the things you do with passion. I have had items on my list to do for awhile and while my heart really wanted to do them, by body/mind would put them off. With Venus Fly Trap, my life is starting to align with my heart, and it feels magical!"

The description given on these are so accurate!! I do feel Full Of effortless Focus and power and opportunities that seem Miraculous are just showing up at my Door ! Ah, happy to hear it, Liberty! May it continue to unfold! :) N N.K. I haven't bloomed :-( Was really drawn to this elixir and after doing the quiz many of the flowers I selected were here.  The reviews were mixed, but each human absorbs and metabolizes differently.  I took as directed 5 drops 5Xs a day for 3 weeks.  There was absolutely no difference and it was just not the elixir I needed.  Haven't bloomed, but that doesn't mean you won;t..    So, I am testing the waters out there to hopefully start to bloom!   Good luck... Hey Nina! Thank you for your feedback! There are some different factors that can be at play here, and each situation is uniquely different. And I am honored to help pinpoint & get to the root of what’s happening here. First, I have a few questions for you: 1. How many times a day are you using the elixir? 2. How long has it been since you first started using it? Everybody reacts at a different pace because we all have our own individual life experiences. Some of us have more layers to work through to uproot patterns than others. And that’s perfectly ok. It’s important to allow 21 days (and consistent use of 5x/day) for the flower essences to fully penetrate your system. Our flower essences work their magic when you have a certain desire, wish or intention. Or you have a certain negative emotion that you want to dissolve. Or impurities that you want to purify. Whatever it is for you - it will take at least 21 weeks for it to go through your whole entire body. Delays in noticing the effects of the flower essences does not mean that the flower elixirs are not working; in fact, sometimes family members will notice a change before the person taking them does. Awareness & self-reflection practices can really be helpful when you’re wanting to track the effects of the flower essences. If you click here, you will find a treasure trove of printable journals & meditations (and so much more) that are all organized by blend. I highly recommend journaling or making time each day to sit quietly for a short meditation practice to tune in with yourself & make space for insights to arise. Lastly, there are several substances that can affect the conductivity of flower essences and create a delay in the perception of noticeable effects. While the effects of flower elixirs can usually be felt within several days, regular consumption of white sugar, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, marijuana, or other drugs can delay the experience of tangible benefits by about a month. This simply means that there is a delay in the awareness of the results, or in having a direct experience of a shift in state of mind. I'd be happy to help you further through this, and chat through any details with you! Please email hello@lotuswei.com xoxo N N.C. A Blessing from God. The effects were initially subtle, or so I thought; occasionally, I forgot a few times in a day to take Full Bloom drops. The next day I would feel the difference as self-doubt tried to creep back in. In this regard, the presence of Bamboo seems to be addressing what is needed inside me the most, and I am grateful for all God's provisions to guide us along our way. I'm two weeks in with Full Bloom and thinking, ""Oh I'll order a new bottle..."" but my instinct is telling me I can move into a new blend to ally with. With the beautiful flower blessings Kate includes here on the descriptions, I know which ones I'll engage with. Thank you Kate for being true to your calling! Much love to you. J Joandra Did not notice much S S.V. Super powerful stuff! The first essence I tried here was Gamechanger. I tried others too, over the years, but none of them were ""it"" for me. I wasn't sure if it was just me or if I wasn't giving them a fair chance, but then I tried Full Bloom, and BAM! I felt the effects immediately. I've been doing a lot of inner work on stepping into my full power all this year. Adding this elixir was like adding a log to that fire. I feel ablaze. Empowered. Confident in myself, no matter what. Even a few recent rejections bounced off of me like I was Teflon. Where before I'd be full of self-doubt following such rejections, overanalyzing everything I did ""wrong"" ad nauseam, this time I just shrugged and moved on, knowing that it wasn't me who was wrong in any way or form. My friends have noticed and commented on this huge transformation too. I just ordered my second bottle. Can't wait to see where I am after 2 months of this. Highly, highly recommended if you're looking to empower yourself from the inside. It works! A A.D. Lovely boost I found that this lovely blend really helped me face my fears head on. I’ve been getting back to more intense workouts after an injury and always take some beforehand. It helped me think outside of the box like what am I truly capable of accomplishing in this lifetime vs what am I conditioned to believe my limits are. It helps to purify fear, and helps to discern that fine line between fear and excitement. I really found myself not caring what anyone thinks or even caring about some of my own thoughts. I recommend practicing observing your thoughts as they arise while on this one, because it helps with discerning what’s truly needed and what’s ready to be released. If you tend to get in your own way a lot this is a good one! Thank you Katie and LW team ❤️ R Rosalia L. Full bloom magic I bought the full bloom elixir, as I had an intuitive hunch that it would help me, and it is incredible. It is not only tasty, but it is helping me soften and break patterns that I have struggled with for as long as I can remember. And I have only been taking it now for about two weeks, so I am really excited to see how it will help me over the next months or maybe even years! Nature is magic, and this product captures its essence in the most beautiful, sensuous form. It's amazing how such pleasure and beauty can lighten and brighten up the healing process, while accelerating it. What joy! And such joy when received can be given and multiplied. Thank you Lotuswei :) I am very grateful. W Winter C. Unexpected! I’ve been taking flowers essences for years and I always have some sort of idea of how things might unfold…however Blossom threw me a curve ball! I took it while going through a rebranding and elevating of my work; what’s it’s helped me see is how I’m coming into the fullest expression of myself and what I do to help others. As a bonus it’s also supported me in my process to romantic relationships; allowing me to be in my feminine completely and clarifying what I seek and want in a counterpart. K Katie G. Landed a new job! As I began taking Full Bloom, I happened to be in the process of interviewing for a new job. I felt self-assured and confident of my skill set. There was a quiet, calming strength that I felt blossom within me each time I interviewed & ended up getting an amazing job! Full Bloom helped me “come into my own.” Loved it! C Carrie S. Leaps and bounds in business, inner peace, and self-reclamation! I've been struggling to find ""right timing"" for years now. I want to both start a freelance writing business and get off my toxic and unnecessary pharmaceutical meds, a withdrawal process that intensifies anxiety and causes extreme brain fog. So these two big goals did not seem to go together, especially when I was overcome with anxiety/fear and self-doubt from birth! I've been doing a ton of healing and trauma work for the last year and a half, and things still did not seem to be moving in the direction of career success or freedom. I toyed with the idea of buying Full Bloom for a couple of month after discovering it, too, feeling it could help give me that extra boost toward empowerment, clarity, and transformation...but hesitated, as I've tried SO many things, and I still seem to stay at the same relative level. :-/ But finally, I made the leap. And I honestly can't believe the results! Within about 2 weeks of taking this elixir, I landed a BIG new client for my freelancing biz who's hiring me on an ongoing basis, AND I felt inspired to resume my medication taper...and when the anxious thoughts and fear hit, after about 5 minutes of fear, I WOKE UP, remembering this was all just my thoughts--my harmless little trauma-pattern-based thoughts--and I was completely fine. I accepted those thoughts for what they were and the discomfort dissolved--a concept I'd heard about but NEVER experienced or thought possible for myself! From that point on, my med decrease has been easeful and peaceful, and I've been working all the way through and feeling sharper, calmer, more inspired, and more MYSELF than probably EVER BEFORE. I'm calm, poised, and assured, and I trust that this IS the right time for ALL of my dreams to start manifesting! Not done with the med taper yet but I'm confident I can get through it and get free while also growing my business, which previously felt impossible. GET THIS ELIXIR!! I want to try the mist next, too, for some added oomph and aromatherapy benefits. LOVE Lotus Wei. They've boosted my self-reclamation process AND my business to the next level! 1 2"

Full bloom serum My first purchase has been this full bloom serum along with the full bloom elixer. I mainly use the serum every night after my shower. I apply to the back of my neck/shoulders, chest area (mainly my heart), and feet. I liked that the description said it dissolves old habits, illusion, negativity, fear, and attachment. I had been struggling for 15 years to end my smoking habit and I knew in my heart that this time was the time to part ways but I was so afraid! I went with this line in hopes my transition would be easier. I knew I had it in me to quit since I had quit before but each time I went running right back because without the smokes I felt like I didn't know who I was. Like a part of me would fade away and I couldn't do that, I didn't want that. Since taking these combos I have come to realize my attachment to cigarettes had been due to not having emotional support growing up. Cigarettes had always been there for me. I could ""talk"" to them about anything without being judged. They were there when I had no one. They've always been there. It was my safety net. I have been crying like a baby releasing past hurts which has been very helpful for me because I have come to a lot of realizations such as healing the broken little girl inside of me. I found my root cause. The reason why I has such a hard time letting cigarettes go.  I have realized I am someone who can do hard things. I am someone worthy. I am someone worthy of love. I know who I am now. A A.S. Very pleased! I am a happy new customer. Just started using Full Bloom yesterday and I immediately had huge benefits. The lovely blend has brought to my attention something I needed to edit from my past to move on freer. The scent is absolutely heavenly and the effects are subtle yet so powerful. I just wish the elixirs would come in a vegan and alcohol free form. I know that it’s possible and I know that, just like me, so many highly sensitive people are also vegan and would love to enjoy the elixirs, too. Katie, would you be willing to open up that door, too? Thanks! Thank you for your lovely review Anna! We're so glad to hear you're enjoying the eye opening possibilities that Full Bloom invites into to your awareness:) I'm sorry that we cannot satisfy your elixir request at this time, but that's the beauty of having many forms of each blend in (and you'll reap the exact same effects!) Also please know Katie works tirelessly to add only the highest quality ingredients to our products! The honey used in the elixirs is sourced from a small organic farm in Brazil & we use a small dosage of organic grape alcohol to preserve the energetic strength of the remedy! D Delaney K. Soft and silky I really look forward to adorning my skin with this luscious serum. It instantly gives a feeling of warmth and luxury, of self-love. The light citrusy spice scent is comforting, and my skin feels smooth and silky.  I have been doing lots of shadow work lately and this has assisted in opening my heart to the possibilities of releasing past hurts and creating space for the new. The act of self-massage with the aid of this serum is a wonderful way to open the body tissues up to create that space and begin to feel more confident in my body. Love it! C Corley M. Refreshing I enjoyed using this serum.  It smells and feels refreshing.  Upon reflection, I noticed a few things that I would correlate to my use of this serum.  I stepped out of my comfort zone a few times which had very positive results for me.  In all instances, my actions  were without agenda, but I was merely following my impulses and intuition which in retrospect led me to some pretty awesome opportunities.  I believe the energetic support of this serum “cleared” the path for me so to say so that when I was clearly guided, I just simply acted with faith and trust, boldness, yet it felt so easeful.  Love it, recommend it! J Jacqueline J. Bloom Bloom Bloom This Full Bloom Flower Essence is great for me. I had experimented with it as a spray and loved it. In serum, it helps me reconnect to the beauty of who I am. In meditation, I ask it to show me or inspire me how I see myself, how I limit myself and how I feel in my life. More I feel beautiful, more I see the beauty in everything. Every day with this serum I feel like a fresh flower just wanting to bloom. S S Y. I love the mint in this serum. It’s a wonderful complement to the anointing oil. S S Y. Fresh and minty, great to have alongside the anointing oil. T Theresa K. I love this! Full Bloom is one of my favorites!"

Magnificent transformational support Within a few days of beginning this magnificent formula, I felt a tremendous shift in how I saw myself. I became entirely aware of how I’d been hiding my beautiful gifts with too many stories that were really only dressed-up fears. Suddenly I saw, joyfully, that what I bring into the world truly is rare and special! For the first time, I decided to offer my visionary services to clients—and within a week I had a client! Then another! And another! It’s like people are magnetized to the beautiful, simple devotional offering I am bringing to the world. Astonishing and delightful! I have so much compassion for the old, smaller version of myself that I’ve now outgrown. And I’m in love with the radiant, expanded me I am becoming with the gracious support of Full Bloom! Deep thanks for this medicine! Magnificent! Your radiant transformation shines so beautifully through! Y Yue W. Love the Full Bloom spray I used up my mist super quickly. I love the immediate effect it gives me. When I spray around my crown and shoulders, I really do feel like an outer layer of fear is softened and peeling away. At a critical career change juncture of my life, this mist is helping feel more daring to take actions, to show up for myself one moment at a time. It's a beautiful mist. Thank you for sharing! Here's to courage & ease! L Lynn P. Great scent I reordered the Full Bloom mist because I love the fragrance so much.  It makes me feel like I’m ready to face the day.

I have felt an opening within me and just a little voice saying you ok, you don’t have to just go along to make someone else feel better or feel ok inside. I am not responsible for how others feel and I feel more open inside me to invite the true me home with open arms. Hey Lisa! We are thrilled to hear that our Full Bloom Mist has brought about a sense of openness and self-awareness for you.

K Katharina Determination in a Bottle I am absolutely in love with my Full Bloom Aura Mist. It was the first product I ever ordered from Lotuswei, and I feel a very special connection to it. I've been taking it for nearly a month and have noticed that I am already SO much more decisive and determined. It also smells divine (refreshingly citrusy). Working with the provided journalling pages has helped me to deepen my experience with the mist even further. I think Full Bloom will always have a special place in my heart from now on, but I am already excited to try the other essences as well. 🌸 S Saumya V.

When collecting Desert Milkweed, I was overcome by waves of anxiety and fear. Ridiculous, as this plant is not endangered nor was i somewhere I shouldn't be, this experience informed by understanding of the flower's essence: it dissolves subconscious patterned fear of persecution or getting into trouble while trying to do good. It helps us let go of worry about what others think and trust that the world is a friendly place, full of benevolence + understanding. MAGNIFIES: Confidence, comfort, and peace with being out in the open and watched by others; having a sense that the world is a benevolent, understanding + friendly place DISSOLVES: Worry about what others think; feeling persecuted; having a sense that others are out to get you, blame you, or that they’re unforgiving Read more about the magic of Desert Milkweed here .

And then it brough about a sense of greater ease and lightnness, feeling more connected with the world, seeing the good things. The one thing that stood out to me that I feel Desert Milkweed  helped me with: when you have been aware of the real darkness in this world, if you've digged deep into the rabbit holes, and you know how much of what we've been told is lies and illusions that keep us stuck in this old system that does not actually honor life and help us cultivate our divinity, it can be hard to go about your life in the same way, we may feel a sense of seperation or see malevolence.... it may be harder to function within society knowing things others can't see....that's when I feel this elixir provides a lot of relief, it helps us not go into fear or be paranoid and disconnected, it bridges the gap, allows us to see things through more light and drop some of the heaviness that we might have carried for lifetimes. Very much needed in our times. :) D Dina Transformation After taking this elixir, I let go of how others perceive me. I was less shy and opened up to my gifts and my voice. I stopped worrying about how others feel. I did a video panel interview for a new position with ease and spoke eloquently during a grouo presentation."

Great for new or regular meditator What a lovely change from my usual meditation practice!! I learned so much from the different practices and received such peace from each one. The most valuable piece was learning to do a dedication at the end of the meditation or any activity I am doing. I loved all of it! Thank you! D Dionne R. A lovely respite I enjoyed these meditation practices very much.  It was great to have something to look forward to coming in my inbox daily and the practices were very easy to incorporate into daily life.  I'm going back through them again now.  Thank you for this lovely gift. K Kathleen K. Awaken the Senses Thank you Katie for sharing ways to awaken the senses. What a beautiful way to incorporate meditation into daily life.  I appreciate this gift. A Aliya P. Unique, Practical, Authentic I love the way you organized this into Teachings and Practices, all of which are doable within time-constraints and life's circumstances. You made it practical yet unique (not the same old body scans and focusing on the breath) -- I absolutely love the isolation of each sense to open ourselves into greater spaciousness and witnessing. It's also very much appreciated that you only share from an experiential, authentic place, and I love that you shared your past struggles and vulnerabilities -- there's so much strength in that for all of us! D Dana Wakefulness Meditation Practice This was wonderful. Beautifully created with specific intentions for each day. I have felt so calm especially during stressful times. N Nancy K. Grateful I am so grateful for you giving us this gift. It was very comforting at a time I was feeling anxious and afraid. Along with taking joy juice elixir and spray I’m feeling calmer. Thank you so much for your kindness. I appreciate it so much! M Micki Love experienced teaching! Such a special offering. I love that Katie presents practices she loves and has worked with herself and experienced. I greatly respect that and trust it so much more than teaching from a manual. Perfect practices to do while breastfeeding my baby! B Brighid D. Very nice This meditation series is very well done. I really enjoy how each meditation is based on one sense. I liked the instruction and the meditations are you short,  yet effective.  Focusing on one sense at a time helps to make make meditation accessible. Sometimes I would be doing the meditation on my phone and the screen will close and I wouldn’t realize it.  I had been sitting in quiet for a bit longer than the meditation because I didn’t realize my phone had paused.  The meditations are very relaxing.  I love your voice and the way that you present it.  You have such a gift with words! It has been very helpful during this difficult time.  Thank you very, very, very much. J Janice H. Wonderful! Thank you Katie so much! I started yesterday with the visual meditation. It was an experience I have never done before and it was so powerful!  Staying in the present and observing a tree in my backyard was so powerful! I can’t even explain it very good with words. But it was truly the present moment I was in for several minutes and it was awesome.  I will continue today !  Thank you for giving us a wonderful gift!  Love. Janice S Sara E. Gentle, simple, effective I, with the support of Grace, was able to carve out ten minutes each day to listen to the recordings and I’m so so glad. They brought to me a little pocket of sanity and I noticed on my daily walks so much more around me! It’s been a pleasure to really hear the birds, taste my toast, and watch the curtains move. It’s brought in a really subtle feeling that brings me to a place of calm and surrender. Thank you for the teachings and mediations! 1 2"

I feel more open and confident in my voice. Kinder and more compassionate than I have felt in a long while. That’s amazing! Love hearing your beautiful transformation. S Sarah G. Presence and Voice I was really drawn to this flower and actually forgot it was related to powerful voice. But in taking it for the last month I have been more vocal and sharing deeper things with clients as well as singing more around people which I used to be shy about. My husband, who was trained in music, has been commenting on how well I sing and naturally harmonize, which is very healing for me since I had some rough experiences with singing and that is actually what I wanted to do professionally for a long time! I am past that idea now, but love feeling freer with both my speaking voice and singing voice and am excited to keep using this elixir and exploring. In addition to using my voice differently with clients, I have been bolder in my work with them and stepping up a lot. S Stephanie H. Open California Glory has opened up my heart space. I am embracing forward movement and finding myself being more compassionate with others and letting go of the past. Life has been throwing curve balls for me lately, but instead of facing them with fear, I'm facing them with love. I know everything is going to be okay. And this elixir has helped me get to this open and loving place. A Anastasia T. Voice opener During the lockdown, my choir wanted to do a virtual choir project and I was feeling rusty without regular practice. After taking a dropper full of this elixir, there was suddenly power in my singing. Its also made me speak up a lot more, in my relationships and business-related connections."

I plan to keep using it for at least a few months! S Saumya Strengthening from inside Hi lotuswei I am so grateful for this beautiful elxir. My experience with this elixir is simple evident. I can feel strength in my legs,my jaw,my teeth.itd been full 33 days using this.  I am going for another 33. The reason why I chose this is I have deep deep father wound and I have very bad experience in romantic relationships. Having developed deep pain for men.i know in my bones I need to heal this.no wonders it's coming from my father. I am deeply hurt with him.with his no strength and I always felt fatherless and longed for father so so much. I am sensing bit of it reducing. Also I notice how my right side has softened.whrn I walk in my corridors,I have been constantly watching how my right shoulder is. Day by day, it has softened. The thing I was looking for to solve ,it feels I have got the beginning of it. I am certain it's my long term remedy.the current healing is so amazing. I am rejoicing it completely. Lotuswei 😘 you are miracle.. E Elena Litvack A true gift I never thought i would be drawn this elixir-  stability and discipline are a challenge for me! Well may be that is exactly what was needed, Trees have been speaking to me with their majestic rootedness and loving patience. I noticed this elixir and it spoke to me, yet I still didn't get it. It took a violent storm and two trees falling, blocking me from moving in any direction to wake up to the call and know i needed this NOW. Working with the divine masculine and healing those gaps within me has been a challenging work that came to me earlier this year. Lots of fear and insecurities, deep anger and pain from abandonment. They weren't so much mine as my son's and ll the worlds' son. It dawned on me that even the darkest of personalities on this earthly stage have come from a mother's  womb, and this mother has witnessed the pain, held space for it and sometimes  even inflicted it. It is a hard pill to swallow, yet that is part of the healing of the Divine masculine and the Divine Feminie within and without that I  hold space for. The redwood elixir helped me find my roots, withstand the storm and gently embrace the pain carried in all of us.  A true gift! M Margaret Healing my parenting While taking redwood I’ve noticed a lot surfacing around being a single parent and specifically the pain around not having a father in my son’s life and in my own life. It’s been incredibly healing to be able to see clearly the impact of not having a father in our lives and feel supported to digest that impact. And specifically it helped me lift self blame and simply see the shortcomings of our situation. Truly did help me address a “father wound” in my life :) C CM Rooted This elixir was so helpful and provided stabilizing support for me during a time of big transition.  Before taking it, I felt so easily knocked from my centre and agitated and worried.  Taking this; I felt deeply anchored, strong and rooted and a sense of confidence in myself and in others to find their “roots” and centeredness, also with my sense of rootedness gave me a sense of stability and trust in the universe and in how my transitionary circumstances might unfold. 1 2 3"

M Maryasque I recommend! Katie Hess with her gentle centered voice takes us on a journey through Taiwan. I am savoring it and today I did the Chaos meditation. How beautiful. I live in NYC so I thought it would feel pretty normal and possibly annoying but I was interested to observe. What kept coming to me was that you cannot chanhe the outer world but you can change your inner world. To be more observing when we choose. Also there is so much life force in the energy of people. Exploring the elements and creatures too has been magnificent. Those are different on different parts of the earth so that was very cool to hear. Looking forward to the rest. As with all things she does, these are special meditations. A truly unique approach to an ancient technique. But isn’t that just meditation in a nutshell?  It’s never the same. Thank you Katie💕"

Grounded in my intuitive knowing I'm writing this review as i order two more bottles! I struggle to stay in my body, and this elixir remedied that. I felt totally grounded, self-assured, and connected to my intuitive knowing. On my walks the lower half of my body felt stronger! It's a truly grounded, embodied feeling. I'm pretty sensitive and tend to have a ""healing crisis"" with a lot of remedies (minus the stabilizing ones), but this one is just pure support. Thank you so much for taking the time to leave a review for our Moonstone Elixir. We are thrilled to hear that it has helped you feel more grounded and connected to your intuition. It's wonderful to know that you have already ordered two more bottles - that's fantastic! We hope that it continues to provide you with the support and stability you need.

I’ve been part of the FlowerEvolution program for nearly a year, and while it took me a little while to open to the possibilities and feel the shifts, the transformation has been profound. Over time, I’ve noticed greater autonomy, clarity, and inner steadiness, along with surprising insights that helped me trust my path more deeply. Bamboo, Moringa, and Yellow Prickly Pear were especially powerful for me—each one gently revealing something I hadn’t realized I needed. This program is more than flower essences—it’s a path of self-awareness, healing, and deep inner growth. If you’re sensitive to subtle energy and ready for meaningful change, I highly recommend it. These are such incredible shifts, Allison! So glad that these last three elixirs have been especially powerful. Thank you for your openness & trust in the process. We're so grateful you're a part of this experience with us! M Michael B. Definitely feeling some shifts... Not easy to quantify with words so I am just remaining open to gratefully receiving everything the flowers and the alchemy of Ketie's insights has to offer. Thank you for being open, Michael & for being a part of this ripple ... whether it can be quantified or not! T Tanisha W. Flower essences are wonderful This is my first time using flower essences. I especially love the Expansive Presence exilir it has worked wonders and I have made many positive changes and have ordered Yellow Prickly Pear. Thank you, Tanisha! So happy to hear Expansive Presence is having such a positive impact, & we hope you love the Yellow Prickly Pear too! D Darla L. Yellow Prickly Pear Thank you for this beautiful product. This is the first one I’ve ordered and am very impressed. The complimentary mist was a pleasant surprise. I spray it over my crown chakra as suggested, say a simple prayer of thanks and find this so calming and nurturing. The Yellow Prickly Pear is equally as nourishing. After going through menopause in my fifties I’ve felt heavy, laden down, carrying excess in my body. Now in my late sixties I’ve been trying various supplements to feel lighter. Some have helped, but this Yellow Prickly Pear truly resonates and I’m already feeling “lifted”. Sometimes, things come along just as you need them. Thank you for this. Lifted and gifted 😄 ❤️ Darla, thank you for sharing your first experience in the Flowerevolution! So amazing to hear Yellow Prickly Pear has come in divine timing & is helping you feel lighter. Lifted and gifted indeed!❤️ E E From psychache to surrender Tried out the flower revolution for the first time (month of March- Red Pentemon and truth spray). I'm blown away with the results!  I've been using both daily for a couple weeks, which has been so easy to remember because of the instant good feelings. Mostly I've noticed an overall improvement of self-trust and sense of safety. Something I struggled with was fear of loss of control when I get angry but this duo of flower essences has dissolved most of that (along with prayer and intentional heart work) and I'm now feeling more confident than ever! I'm able to be in the flow more easily despite feeling irritable or angry. It also appears that insight into my own needs is easier to access within my mind and spirit. Grateful for finding lotuswei and thank you to the people making it all happen. Wow, what a powerful month to begin! Love that you noted the flower essences are an easy habit to remember because they feel that good right away - it's so true!! So grateful these flowers are supporting your growing self-trust & sense of safety, and grateful you're a part of this program with us. Thank you for sharing, E. <3 z zelda Inspiring and Supportive! I look forward every month to getting my new essence and supporting essence blend!  Interesting how the flowers work with us to reveal things and support us in making changes.  I do believe I have been developing more resilience in my system.  I have been on a long journey of healing and transformation.  It has taken a long time to feel this strong and clear.  I find these essences are really supporting me, and it's great to take this journey alongside other people!  I love the gatherings at the end of the month, though I don't always make it there.  I am so grateful for Lotuswei, and all that is available through this business and community! Grateful for you! Excited to support your journey. D Denise A.G. New Revelations I wasn't sure what to expect - I downloaded the journal prompts and completed them, put the screen saver on laptop and cell. Took my drops 5x daily, sprayed with mist. I did find myself becoming 'effortless' in some areas. This works! Grateful you experienced effortless shifts — thank you for sharing! P Peggy S. Magic I started the Flower Evolution mid December and wondered if I would get the full benefit (any benefit)  in only 2 weeks - but I felt amazing things happen in just 1 week!  I love all of the accompanying information, prompts, and classes putting me more in tune with the flower of the month.  I have noticed changes in my physical body and even more in my mental and emotional body - and since each one affects the other, they've been drops of magic. So wonderful to hear, Peggy! Happy to have you with us in the Flowerevolution! C Clara P. Love the flower evolution The flower evolution is a great experience that I look forward to every month.  It’s great getting to know individual flower essence but my favourite part is the group discussion at the end of the month.  It’s a perfect time to reflect on how much the flower essence has shifted in a persons life and  I am always amazed when I do the reflection at what has all shifted.  Definitely would recommend this experience. So happy to hear, Clara! Thank you for being part of the community! L Laura L. Journey of self discovery I have been participating in the FlowerEvolution program for over 10 years- and I love the blends too. I have made profound inner shifts with so many of the flowers, and love learning about them too. I recall one flower triggered and released buried memories from a heartbreak 10 years prior (!), and another flower supported deeper worthiness and enoughness - I called it the “queen flower”. Some flowers drew out wonder, joy and imagination and others revealed unconscious fears that were running in the background, unknowingly blocking desires, dreams and full potential. Just last month I made a connection around co-dependency and avoiding my own self responsibility. The insights have been transformational.  It’s also so valuable to engage with a more intimate community and be in a dialogue with Katie, the founder and alchemist.  Give it a try! Laura! 10 years ~ wow. Incredibly grateful that we've been a part of your powerful journey of self-discovery. :) We LOVE you! 1 2 3"

S Stephanie Self Love While taking Bonsai Plum Blossom I noticed I gave myself some slack. I stopped worrying about getting everything done ""right"" and just went with the flow. I let go of ideas of how I ""should"" be and just started being me. Overall, a good elixir if you need to spend more time with self care and self love.

Replenishing I am a first time user of your products.  I learned about cacao flower from Katie's presentation on personal flower allies.  Hearing of its benefits to assist finding nourishment, I experienced an embodied inner ""Yes!"" response.  Since taking it, I notice that I actually feel good more often, and easily pivot to choosing what replenishes me .  These changes are so supportive after carrying effects of stress on body and mind over the past few years.  Thank you LOTUSWEI! So grateful for your experience—may replenishment surround you! C Corley M. Nourishment I ordered this during a time of physical burnout and stress, after a big move.  Most fortunately, I intuitively ordered it before a traumatic event occurred as well. I have had long standing patterns of my mind overriding the callings of my body.  Taking this, I was able to tune in to the requests of my physical body more clearly.  I was drawn to warm nourishing foods, and foods that were I supportive of my body were less appealing.  I found myself sleeping more. This essence supported me in nourishing myself during a highly stressful time and it was deeply supportive.  Many thanks for sharing these potent flower remedies. E E.H. Really wonderful I'm just about through my first bottle, and ordered two more. I was initially drawn to the essence after feeling incredibly burn't out and exhausted with my work. I was in a bit of a rut of waking up, working, coming home, and zoning out. I was skipping lunch because I had no time in my schedule to eat it, and didn't feel I had time to invest in much self-care. After the third week of taking this essence, I noticed some major shifts. I re-evaluated my work schedule and let go of clients who no longer aligned. I added breaks into my day, no longer allowing myself to skip lunch. I started re-engaging with a morning movement, meditation and breathwork routine, and actually sticking to it. I started to notice when I was self-sacraficing and made necessary changes to correct it. I stopped eating sugar and junk food to cope with my stress, and instead reached for foods that would nourish me for the long haul. It's wild to reflect back on how effective this essence has been in such a short amount of time. I'm super grateful! S S.A. A magical exoerience for sure! I was attracted to many of the elixers but decided on the cacao flower essence and radiant energy for my first purchase. I believe it is perfect timing when you choose a specific flower. To me it was food and feeling uncomfortable in my body at times and I can feel a shift in my choices of food and different new things definitely came to me or I was drawn to! I received new recipe ideas that everyone enjoyed and so much inspiration and new creative ideas was flowing to me the past 3 weeks. My energy is at a different level for sure (Radiant Energy) I found myself so happy and my resiliance is so much stronger it felt like nothing could get me down. I also discovered one of the flowers (Jade Succulent) growing in my front garden! So much more aware now of all the beautiful magical flowers aroind me. And our security estate's name is also Jade Park 😁In the last years I felt so un appreciated and this also started to feel better again. I would get an unexpected phone call or just a feeling in my heart. Thank you Katie, this is a game changer and I am looking forward to more new experiences in the future! J J.E. truly nourishing cacao elixir I purchased this after I was done using the full bloom elixir, because it dawned on me then that I needed some nourishment in my life to truly bloom. This cacao elixir is just what I needed! It worked it's magic fast on me. I found myself craving home-cooked meals versus grabbing a bowl of cereal for breakfast. I used to eat a lot of fast food/junk because I never knew what I was hungry for but with this elixir I just knew what my body needed. I didn't have to guess or feed my body junk that it doesn't deserve. I found myself enjoying to cook. I also found myself getting out of the house often to catch some sun and fresh air! It all came to me instinctively. I will for sure purchase more in the near future. A A.B. Essential to my self care This is just what I needed. Definitely getting a second one. The way it worked for me was that it made it easier to be more present at different points of my day and mindful about covering my essential needs. Very nourishing. Thank you for this amazing elixir! L L.P. Life-changing I have many food allergies since childhood and often felt like there’s nothing I can eat. This led to nutritional deficiencies and feelings of hopeless - both that I’d never feel better and how limited I felt in my ability to travel or even work long days away from home. Cacao has completely shifted my reality. Soon after beginning to work with it I walked into the store and it was as if a spot light was shinning on all the foods I could eat. Things that had always been there but I couldn’t see before. I also feel that I’m absorbing more nourishment from the foods I do eat. Now as my batteries are finally able to recharge I’ve been able to add an additional day at my acupuncture clinic, and have energy for new hobbies and expressions. It has also helped me explore many of the beliefs/traumas underlying these allergies and meet them with compassion. I know that as I continue to work with Cacao I will heal more and more. Thank you so very much for this offering! B B.K. Nourishes your inner child This elixir is so calming and nourishing. I used way too much of it and the bottle was empty in a heartbeat. Expect warmth and the feeling of being taken care of from the heart. A Alexandria C. So Comforting This elixir does what it promises and more. Since using it, I've noticed a gentle shift in how I take care of myself. I've been more mindful of what I eat, the quality of my sleep, and of the need to slow down and relax. Love this one! H Helene C. Love this essence! I am on my second bottle! I love this stuff! After feeling in a slump from staying home due to the COVID 19 pandemic, I am feeling much better now. I am walking 3 miles a day and eating better as well. This essence is just what I needed. 1 2"

Sacred Datura Flower Elixir,Sacred Datura Flower Elixir,"Description Use Ingredients Delicious honey elixir infused with flower essences. 5 drops, 5 times a day, under the tongue. Sacred Datura is a desert moonflower that falls into the ‘poison cures poison’ category. Though toxic to the body in plant form, as a flower essence it actually helps us release toxins - mental, emotional, physical. It helps us cleanse energetic debris through the breath and boosts our lifeforce.

Like bathing in moonlight, we transmute our ‘dark night of the soul’ into strength and wisdom. MAGNIFIES: Strength, wisdom, release, deep breathing, euphoria, mental clarity, lifeforce/chi energy; shines light into dark places; light at the end of the tunnel; new perspective, different spin/take on things; creative solutions DISSOLVES: Dark night of the soul, overwhelm, aggression, sadness, stress, panic, frustration, worry, tension, addiction. Headaches or experiencing toxicity on a physical, emotional, mental or energetic level USE: Enjoy 5 drops sublingually 5 times each day regularly until bottle is finished; or put a dropperful in your water bottle each morning and drink throughout the day. GET CREATIVE: Morning coffee, party punch, restaurants, water bottle, child’s water or juice, pet’s water, cocktails.

So Profound Finding Lotuswei has been such an incredible gift. I have received so much insight into how my own patterns are inhibiting my growth and adding to my struggles. This elixir was one of the most profound ones I have tried. It was magnificent in showing me how my patterns although have looked different from the surface are all stitched together with a common thread. I had some uncomfortable realizations on this blend. I am so grateful for them however because I feel free and feel the light at the end of the tunnel just as it suggests! I also did have some hiccup spells. Thank you Lotuswei! M M. Full moon ritual I was incredibly excited to see the sacred datura flower offered! I love it so much for all its wisdom, beauty, and divinity. I got this to use as a ritual with full moons as well new moons. :) The experiences I’ve had over time have been further illuminated by taking this with gratitude. It’s beautiful to merge with both the moon and sacred Moonflower. Sacred Datura has nourished my growth. E E.J. helped I have tried many times to drop the diet soda habit and my resolve usually lasted around a week. During my last attempt I added taking this essence to my daily routine.  Cravings for this beverage that I know is not good for me are much less. I think I have had two in the last three months....and none in the last month. I think this helped!! Thank you:) c callie p. A lot While I had a lot of stress going on when I started this, it amplified it. It continues to bring up my self-doubt that I've been struggling with it for a very long time. My blood glucose levels raised, and I feel like this brought many issues to the surface that I didn't realize was still an issue. S Stacey A. Helped my workaholic husband! Hello, I just wanted to take a moment and share how much this product has helped my husband. He's been worried, stressed and overworked for the last four years, and most especially over the last 18 months. I requested that he try the Sacred Datura Essence and I can tell it's making a big difference. His mood has improved and he's even started delegating tasks he would normally just powered through himself. I can just see an overall letting go and return to positivity. Thank you so much for creating this special formula. I am delighted that something so simple is making such a difference to my beloved hubby. O Oana A.T. It does what is says it does 💚 Sacred datura has helped me release so many emotions that I was scared to let to the surface with so much ease than before...yes it has made me see the light at the end of the tunnel with so much wisdom . I will definitely repurchase this elixir 💚🙏 R Robyn R. helped me w emotional clearing Shortly after starting this elixir I had a pretty huge release of til then repressed energy and emotion related to a trauma that occurred many years ago. It is still ongoing as I continue to use this elixir. Not easy- but worth it to unwind and let go of all this. M Margaret W. strengthening energetic boundaries My big takeaway from my time of using Sacred Datura was help seeing how I was not honoring my own life energy. This plant really helped me see how I was very freely giving away of my emotional and energetic resources and how it was exhausting me, and fueling some deeper frustration. It gave me the awareness I needed to take the steps to practice and tighten boundaries so that I was respecting myself in how I gave away or shared my inner resources. SO much gratitude to this flower for what it showed me about myself! C Corley M. Cleansing on all levels I am so happy I took this and will come back to this flower again in future.  While taking it, my chronic ear infection flared up and I initially felt tired.  In time, my infection cleared and I know it’s healed at a deeper level then in past.  By the end of taking it, I feel very clear And energized  as if I’d just completed a detox. I detoxed - became aware of various emotional patterns and disharmonious beliefs over the course of taking it and seeing and releasing them has been liberating.  I feel like a new person.  I highly recommend this and I know I will come back to it often.  Thank you Lotus Wei for sharing it. E Elena L. Pure magic Sacred datura Is gentle but profound magic. It feels like desert flower opening in my  subtle channels and blooming in visions that guides my spirit to trust it's innate wisdom It feels supportive nurturing  and loving. Like a gentle hug that allows the alchemy to transform and bring out deepest layers. 1 2"

Pieris softens the sadness I lost my best dog ever last month after 13 years. He was the coolest and I’m left in deep sadness. This flower has softened my despair and I can focus on how awesome he is and the great times we had. I’ve recommended it to many people who have also lost their beloveds. It’s a beautiful tool to incorporate when you know things are going to be different and likely sad. Thank you Katie & team. J Juliana Y. Surprising I lost my mother 6 months ago and there have been a lot of personal changes in my life this year. The grief of losing loved ones and not to mention the grief of being in quarantine and away from friends and loved ones added to the grief.  After taking the elixir I noticed more of a calming in my heart and I feel a lot more grounded. K Kristin C. Softening This elixir has really awakened my heart. The grief is coming out, I am processing it. The dreams are showing me the way. Knowing the only way out is through, and allowing the elixir to do what it does softly. S Sara F. I bought this when Katie wrote about using it for COVID times and I love it.  I keep it by my bed.  Overall, I have been very fortunate during COVID as I have kept my job and have really dug back into some great practices with the increased time of not traveling.  But there are days that I wake up and feel the heaviness of this whole change we are going through.  A friend told me that it is time to practice feeling the feels and then pivoting back to the light.  This elixir is awesome at helping me do that.  It has been so useful!!  Thanks! L Liliana C. Beat the quarantine blues I ordered this elixir specifically to help me get through quarantine and social distancing due to covid-19. I, like I’m sure a lot of people are, had been feeling really down and like the world was just crumbling as a whole. This has helped show me the light at the end of the tunnel and feel much more positive!"

I don't recommend buying any oils from here because its not a full 4ml but the exilers are full and healing and healthy. Hi Karley, I totally understand your concern! Our anointing oils actually come in a 5ml bottle, which we don’t fill completely as it causes leakage problems & causes the tops to become deformed. Because of the space left in the top of the bottle, the volume is 4ml for each anointing oil. I hope that’s helpful! B B.F. In-joy this tremendously! I've been using it for several weeks and love the strength this oil lends to me. It has a decidedly strong scent, but so soft and floral, almost like the smell of baby's breath flowers. When I use it I feel uplifted and a sense of strength with calmness and grounding. Very similar to the grounding sensation I feel when I burn dry bay leaf. When I shared it with my daughters they both had a similar reaction to the initial application, ""oh wow!"" ...feels transformational just to breathe it in. J Jen B. Lovely This anointing oil is the most amazing scent. I cannot describe it but it instantly draws me. Its beautiful to wear and makes me smile when I smell it. M M. Happy soursop cotton Candy The presence of all I have been working within and without is given smiles and giggles with this. I say so because it smells like soursop (Guanabana) to me. The aromatheraputic benefits bring me to how o feel when eating the fruit with an aroma enticing the membranes of my nose.. such a powerhouse! With that, this is always a moment when I feel happy like others with Cotten candy at a carnival, celebrating life ubiquitous. C C.M. Intoxicating Aroma I love the aroma of this annointing oil.  It feels so nourishing and loving to use and every time I catch a whiff of the scent as I move throughout my day, I am reminded of my intention to be nourished and receive.  Since using this, I have noticed myself being more in tune, taking some breaks, resting and allowing myself to be replenished.  I’ve resumed my yoga practice to rejuvenate and nourish myself. In the past, anointing oils were a less preferred way to work with the essence, but I’m finding myself more drawn to them.  They are such a sensuous way of experiencing the essence, feeling the physical touch and smelling the aroma.  I am one whose tendency is to be disconnected from my body and ungrounded and I find using the anointing oils to be grounding and help me lovingly connect and anchor in my body. S S Y. The smell seemed strange and sharp/sourish in the first couple of weeks, and over time became sweeter and more powdery. Felt much more comfortable in my own skin using this, and prompted to take more restful breaks. C Chelsey G. Wow. At first I didn't like the smell of this anointing oil, but after applying it a few times, I fell in love. It's so hard to explain - it's like clay and warm flowers and sweet fruit. Beyond the aromatherapy, the results of using this essence have been transformational. There has been immense interpersonal healing in a way I didn't even know was possible - I feel SO much more open-hearted, forgiving, and liberated. I wasn't expecting these results, but the huge shifts have been undeniable. E Elizabeth H. sweet & familiar This is a soft and sweet scent- powdery floral- that I also found similar to the open heart anointing oil. This just meant that I then shared one of the oils with my mom since the scent- at least to me- was so similar. D Debbie P. Wow, amazing! WOW I love this annointing oil so much, I've been doing a combination of wild abundance and expansive presence oils as a perfume for the last month and so much has shifted: my man was offered a new job (with double pay) and we have received a lot of attention for our creative projects too.  The combination of these oils smells SO Divine and I received a ton of compliments all month long.  I'm planning to incorporate Joy Juice and make it a trio next and feel really excited about it! E Eveline A. Smell divine When I first met this oil, I wasn’t sure if I like the smell of it. To me, it smells powdery  and slightly rubbery. But after a short while, the fragrance grew on me and now this oil is my go to when I want to smell divine and expanded. 1 2"

I'm at a transition point in my life, and Expansive Presence enabled me to float in a higher perspective, which is helping me manifest immense life changes. It is also infusing my paintings with this incredible vibe. It's my favorite! So happy it's uplifting your life and art! C C.A. Subtle yet transformational all at once I was in a creative rut, lacking motivation and I ordered this about two months ago and at first, I felt subtle little changes -- like a little more motivation, a few more ideas coming to me, a feeling of ""wanting to be seen publicly."" I just finished the bottle and looking back, all I can say is wow! This is magic! In the past two months, I acquired three new voice students, started a new job, started making money as an Amazon affiliate, and started to update my website. I took it everyday (a dropper full in my water bottle) and set intentions and now looking back I can say wholeheartedly -- I am so grateful for this elixir and Lotus Wei. My jaw dropped slowly more & more as I read your review! Wow, thank you for sharing that reflection! Watch out world! ; ) A A.L. In My Feminine Energy This elixir definitely triggered a lot of ideas and divine downloads. It pushed me to think of trying new things that I had not considered, and to just feel free to explore. The expansive presence elixir also emphasized me to focus on nurturing my feminine energy, whether it be topics I want to learn (ex. beauty rituals, natural health remedies, Goddess myths) or ""feminine"" activities I needed to focus on (baking, cooking, resting more, spending time at altar). Thank you for leaving such beautiful feedback :) T T I have a lot of these elixirs and have also made my own for years but these are my favorites♥️ Thank you so much :) C C.M. Letting Go of Control My long time pattern is to try and control everything. I have an idea that I must do and all falls on my shoulders.  Also, being a mother of three, this pattern can be exacerbated with me feeling I must take care of everything.  My visions are big but I feel I must power and do it all. Taking this elixir facilitated a big shift and freed up energy for me.  I had the sense that I was co-creating instead of bearing sole responsibility for tasks, others, co-creations.  In a stressful circumstance, I was able to surrender and rest into trust. I found myself able to speak up and stand up for myself where I’d otherwise be timid.  I was also truly safeguarding and honouring my needs and allowing myself to be nourished.  I felt held. Thank you for the alchemy creating this flower essence and helping to share the magic of Mother Earth that is available to us. C C.M. Feeling Held This is my favourite Lotus Wei blend. I have taken it before and was drawn to take it again.  My patterns before beginning were escalating stress and pushing / working harder to accomplish some goals.  Immediately after taking a few drops, I felt the deepest sense of peace, that all is well.  I observed a dramatic shift in energy that is hard to describe.  Almost as if I felt held in a blanket of energy, and less defined sense of seperation and me only. I felt very supported. Since taking it, I’ve observed synchronicities and things have been falling into place.  Things I had thought I wanted to do just seemed to magically work out on their own.  Magic. I love the scent of the anointing oil and mist as well. A A.P. soothing and expressive Really loved this one. My heart warms and radiates after taking this powerful elixir -  truly beautiful thank you. A A.D. Current favorite I really enjoy how this helps me focus in on what’s most important and prioritize tasks K Kirsten Y. Expanding the space that I hold for others Within the first week of taking expanded presence, I facilitated some particularly powerful healing sessions for a couple of my clients. When I take this flower essence I feel energetically bigger and stronger and that seems to naturally support me in holding an expanded space for my clients to have especially powerful healing and transformative experiences. This flower essence helps me to be as big as I really am and that seems to create powerful experience for me and everyone I come into contact with which is particularly supportive as I expand my offerings with my work at this time. I've tried many of the flower essences from Lotus Wei and now and then I hit ones that seem to really click in for me. The most powerful ones for me personally have been true strength, inspired action and expanded presence. L L.P. Profound Expansive Presence has been profound in the healing and insights it continues to bring. I had a dream about how this elixir helps me. In it I was backed into a corner of a room by insecurities, fears, playing small, negative self talk, etc. Expansive Presence helped me stand up and climb over the wall of the room and just leave it all behind me so that I could step more fully into my true divine essence. The word that comes to mind is Liberation. It helps me to see/experience the divine in all beings, which feels like I am simultaneously everything and nothing, and from this place abundance and grace flows. 1 2 3"

Running Iris Flower Elixir,Running Iris Flower Elixir,"Description Use Ingredients Delicious honey elixir infused with flower essences. 5 drops, 5 times a day, under the tongue. Despite overwhelm or chronic fatigue from daily modern life, Running Iris dissolves our tendency to view our experiences as laborious, tiring or a drag on our energy. With the people who surround us on a daily basis: rather than avoidance, isolation or feeling like ‘it’s all about me and how I feel’, we’re able to authentically engage with others in a more meaningful and intimate way. Running Iris magnifies our ability to focus, and be aware, flexible and tolerant. MAGNIFIES: Being in tune, in touch, and able to focus (even if chronically overwhelmed, stressed or ill); flexibility and tolerance despite constant overwhelm, stress or fatigue; enhances more of a moment-to-moment awareness and appreciation; expanded and spacious mind. DISSOLVES: Isolation; tendency to view things as laborious, tiring, or a drag on your energy; pushing others away; intolerance, stagnancy and rigid beliefs around health. USE: Enjoy 5 drops sublingually 5 times each day regularly until bottle is finished; or put a dropperful in your water bottle each morning and drink throughout the day. GET CREATIVE: Morning coffee, party punch, restaurants, water bottle, child’s water or juice, pet’s water, cocktails. FEEL A DIFFERENCE: Most people feel a dramatic difference in their everyday state of mind within 2-3 days, with a cumulative effect over time. If used regularly, bottle lasts 3-4 weeks, enough time to experience a significant shift in mood and everyday life. Safe (& excellent) for children over 12 months of age.

As soon as I saw this flower elixir, I knew it was exactly what I needed! For me there has been some major energy shifting - it's not just in the world (protests, riots, destruction, rebellion), but in the cosmos (three eclipses in less than a month!), and in me (I had an energy healing last month that left me feeling out of joint) - I have been feeling emotionally exhausted and my catch phrase over the past few weeks has been, ""Please leave me alone,"" which is very unlike me. I just received my elixir today and I am already feeling better after my first few doses! I have even found myself being more willing to engage with others and reaching out to them, something I haven't felt like doing in several weeks. I sense there is a lot going on in the world right now for pretty much everyone and there are seriously LARGE energetic shifts going on, so I cannot say enough how grateful I am for Katie and the Lotus Wei team for making this elixir available at such an auspicious time, know that you are so appreciated and loved for what you do for the world *hugs*"

Expansive Presence I have been doing Flower Readings for family and friends. Expanive Presence helped me put myself, and the flowers out there! I did a reading for the owner of a local metaphysical store, and we are working on her putting my readings out via the store! I always struggle with marketing myself, so I appreciate the help of Expansive Presence! So glad Expansive Presence is helping you shine! T T S. As always it’s amazing Although it took 10 days for the box to arrive and I have only been using it for 4 days I have begun to notice a difference. Today I almost cut my finger off and it was very useful in staying present and positive throughout the process. So far I am pleased. Glad to hear it's already making a difference for you! G Gayane Truly expansive I purchased this myst at a Flowerlounge in Orange County. When I brought it home, I initially had a repulsive reaction to it. I thought that I might have purchased a wrong item or possibly it was expired. I did acknowledge my feelings of mistrust and I also asked someone on Katie’s team to confirm if this was the right myst. I was told “Yes, it’s the right one.” I have to admit that I didn’t enjoy spraying it around my body but then, the resistance started to melt and although I can’t fully say I embraced the smell completely, it DID support me in expanding my presence and crown chakra. I felt drawn to work with the Akashic Records. A few weeks later through synchronicity, I discovered that an Akachic Records teacher was flying in from Canada to a yoga studio in my area to offer training. I signed up and felt like I was in the right place, doing what I was meant to be doing! Thank you! Thank you for embracing the journey—truly expansive indeed! M MC expansive presence mist Was looking forward to using this product - however the fragrance is too unpleasant for me: To me it smells like bubblegum and is not relaxing or expansive. The Icelandic Moss elixir was/is wonderful and effective. Apparently elixirs may work better for me than a mist. I completely understand your reaction to the mist. Interestingly, I had a similar experience with the scent of Expansive Presence when I first started using it—it’s a very unique, powdery fragrance that some people either love or find challenging. For me, it was the Orris Root that stood out as particularly distinctive, and it took me a few months to truly appreciate its complexity. Now, I can’t get enough of it! Something I’ve noticed, and that we’ve also observed with others, is that when a scent feels unpleasant at first, it can sometimes be an indication of a “healing crisis.” Essentially, it’s your body responding to the essence, letting you know there may be some emotional or energetic resistance to the support it’s offering. This phase is usually short-lived and lasts only a few days, after which the body begins to release what it’s been holding onto. If you feel open to it, we encourage you to continue using the mist gently and see how your experience evolves. That said, your personal preferences are always the most important. If elixirs are a better fit for you, then that’s a beautiful discovery in itself! Thank you again for sharing your journey with us—we’re grateful for your feedback and wish you continued growth and expansion with our flower essences. K Kerri This smells incredible! Definitely helps shift the energies in the room. J J.C. Please Don’t Stop Using It (I Say This With Love) I seriously was in the prime of my life when I was using this. Lack didn’t exist. As a person who previously focused on limitations, it felt so good to be in a place emotionally and physically where I truly saw the abundance that already surrounds me and openness to receive endless possibilities. A famous quote from “The Compound Effect” said something along the lines of “we stop doing the things that made us successful.” I just realized I stopped using it and I am almost completely out. My life is also in a very different place. I realize that I have gotten distracted and off track with a lot of things and this is something  that added value to my beautiful life so I will be repurchasing! :) it also smells delightful!!! Can’t recommend this enough!!! A A.S. Love this mist... really expansive! I have introduced this mist to my several other essences that I am using at this time in my deep dives in awareness and I actually felt a difference, like it is completely ok to have it all. I was already working on that area and I believe that this essence supported me in a beautiful way along with how the circumstances have presented themselves over the past few days. I definitely recommend this essence, it does bring a matrix of expansion that makes it easier to accept your greatness and your good. The smell is kind of sweet and peculiar, then soon becomes like a sweet breeze. Katie is without a shadow of a doubt indeed a master in this art. So far I tried 12 different essences and I love them all ;) S Sharon F. Take up the space that is rightfully yours! I bought this to have on my desk as energetic ""bookends"" to the sessions I have with my clients (I am a certified Functional Medicine Health Coach). I always had a tendency to play it small and not realize my own worth, so when people (personally or professionally) pushed back, were louder than me, or asked more of me than was ""agreed"" upon I just caved...with my time, with my energy, and with my output/work. It was always the feeling of being less important than everything and everyone around me. For example, I would go way over with my sessions if I said it was time to end and clients kept saying, ""Just one more thing."" Spraying ""Expansive Presence"" right before and after each session has helped me fully embody myself so I can create the necessary boundaries to be more sure of myself, speak up, take better care of myself, and be more successful. Plus, it has a very uplifting, fresh, and empowering scent that is like a beautiful reset button for me...and like a friend cheering me on! C Carla S. Great! I'm loving using this mist! It feels so refreshing and makes me smile whenever I use it! C Corley M. Love it.  Smells and feels divine. I love this spray.  It smells and feels divine.  The shift in energy and mood that I feel is so potent and it makes me feel so happy. This product and the wisdom of these flowers have helped me dissolve fears, learn to accomplish things in an entirely different and creative way - with ease, gentleness and an intention to receive, and have supported me in stepping out to do the things my heart yearned to.  Thanks to the support of this blend, I have the joy of sharing my work and gifts with others, which fills my heart.  Thank you so much! 1 2"

MAGNIFIES: Fearless equipoise, peaceful neutrality, freedom from dualistic perceptions, experiencing a new kind of freedom in the body and in our expression; allows more of what’s inside to come out in a balanced, poised way: “This is me,” in a simple, unassuming way. But “this is me” is also a mind-blowing introduction to your own true self-arising nature. DISSOLVES: Wildest fears, worst nightmare, paranoia, frantic, worry, disgust, not wanting to see what’s ugly; fear of emotions overwhelming you or overtaking you; causes of fear and dissolves fear out of the body; extreme dualistic perceptions of good/bad, black/white, right/wrong.

Dissolves aggressive insecurities All I can say about this is WOW! I'm writing this for my husband. His personal insecurities kept getting between our normal daily lives. there was a lot of blaming and shaming happening coming from insecurity as well as a lot of his own frequent negative self-talk. Since he used this essence I've noticed he doesn't speak bad about his own physical appearance anymore NOR does he any longer nitpick mine! He used to tell me what I should and shouldn't eat and how I should work out. None of that anymore. It used to be almost daily. He hasn't mentioned any of that in months now and I can tell he feels better, so much more balanced, and accepting of himself and others! This has opened up intimacy between us in such a deep and purely sweet way. In love all over again! J J. It Happens As They Say If your thinking of buying please note that the 24 hour healing crisis mentioned that could happen….happens! It only last a day and you will feel all over the place, irritated, feeling of out of control, discomfort, extremely sleepy,  lost, even grumpy. But your okay, it will pass. Take time to cater to what your body is asking/ needs. The next day will be 100% better after your body has dispelled toxins and stagnant energy, the next day you will feel better, more neutral and spacious. This works similar to Quiet mind elixir, calming down the chatter, fear  and worry in your mind. H HL Confidence I ordered this for my young daughter who was having some fears around a few things.  She likes to take “honey drops” with mom so I thought I would get her her own to conquer these things with just a little help.  I have noticed in just a few short weeks her fears diminish (she doesn't even talk about them anymore) and I have noticed in general her confidence is shining more.  Its so rewarding to see her flourish as a mom.  These flower essences are nothing short of amazing to me and my family! V Valerie Chia Intense, but what I needed I experienced intensity and my shadows in my first week of taking. I see this as what is required for me at the moment. S Sarah Moving through it I have been taking this elixir along with Royal Poinciana flower elixir. I just wrote a review about that one and how it is helping me to recognize that my way with my work and way of life, which is very unconventional, is perfect for me and embracing that more. On a more personal note, unconscious and unspoken patterns that hold my birth family together have been very pronounced and I have been attacked for not falling into line with these. This elixir, along with my own practice of awareness and change, has helped me to move through this much more smoothly and quickly than in the past. To know who I am and be happy with that without engaging the trauma and drama of this or the family reality. so grateful for this peace and freedom. 1 2 3"

The Expansive Presence helps me to be kind to myself.  Strong self care, feelings of deserving, letting go of concerns are some of the benefits I have noticed when using this essence.  I love to put the serum on my feet at night.  When used together with the Night Blooming Cereus, my nightly dreams are out of this world.  I feel connected and healed while resting and rejuvenating.  I have had continuous challenges with disturbing dreams, dreams that don’t resolve, and dreams around lack of boundaries.  When using this combination of Expansive Presence and Night Blooming Cereus, I feel that I am bringing my “presence” to whatever fears that cause the disturbing dreams.  It has literally changed the way I care for myself, the way I think, and function in the world.  I encourage anyone to try it!! J Jacqueline Boudreau Expansive & Lush I have been using this serum every day and love the lush benefits it gives my skin but also the energetic qualities it provides as well. I couple this with the elixir and have found the flowers in this blend to catalyze confidence, clearer + more confident presence and a deep connection with myself - feeling like a proverbial anchor to come back to again and again. The past few weeks have also been that of attracting beautiful, new and aligned opportunities. Can't get enough of the flowers. xo T Tabitha Supportive Serum I ordered this, along with some Infinite Love products and the Crystal Clear lip balm, prior to knowing everything that was about to happen in the world. You just have to love intuition! This has turned out to be a powerhouse trio- giving me support and allowing to handle people with love while speaking my mind. As Katie described it in her IG video, this serum does remind me of strawberries. I haven’t specifically noticed more support from men (though I already had some supportive men in my life), but I have noticed a lot of support from women and feeling supported overall. A Anonymous Something Special I have tried quite a few products and have liked pretty much all of them, but found this one to be in a class of its own. After reading Katie's article about it, I understood why..It is a ""3.0"" mixture, kind of moving beyond the previous lines. The scent is a bit tangy, light, not sweet or heavy. Although there is already a ""Game Changer "" in the line up, I think this is one too. Nice antidote to Quarantine mind.  Different vibe and scent profile than Radiant Energy but also uplifting."

Taiwan Azalea Flower Elixir,Taiwan Azalea Flower Elixir,"Description Use Ingredients Delicious honey elixir infused with flower essences. 5 drops, 5 times a day, under the tongue. I collected the Taiwanese Azalea in the wilderness of Yilan. Alongside a river, these wildflowers grow on a sharp cliff, occasionally falling into the water like flower offerings. This wild azalea helps us see from a higher perspective: the moment we think we have it all figured out, something else arises. It dissolves the sense that there is only way, or that what we want is unattainable, or too much to ask for. It helps us let go of holding back, so we can engage in deeper generosity of character and offer ourselves to the world. MAGNIFIES: generosity of character; seeing things from a higher perspective; wonder of the magical, weird, odd world that we live in - there's a whole world out there to explore; the moment you think you have something figured out, you discover something else DISSOLVES: being miserly, holding onto things for oneself, only one way it can be done, guilt of holding back USE: Enjoy 5 drops sublingually 5 times each day regularly until bottle is finished; or put a dropperful in your water bottle each morning and drink throughout the day. GET CREATIVE: Morning coffee, party punch, restaurants, water bottle, child’s water or juice, pet’s water, cocktails. FEEL A DIFFERENCE: Most people feel a dramatic difference in their everyday state of mind within 2-3 days, with a cumulative effect over time.

Purple Wishbone Flower Elixir,Purple Wishbone Flower Elixir,"Description Use Ingredients Delicious honey elixir infused with flower essences. 5 drops, 5 times a day, under the tongue. As we river-traced up into the luscious jungle cliffside, indigo butterflies led us to the Purple Wishbone flower. It grows in a quiet, protected area and initially the flower was unnerving to look at. It digs deep into what’s stored in our underbellies, pulls it up and liberates it from our mouths, dissolving fear of judgment. We are better equipped to face our fears of being exposed to aspects of ourselves or the underbelly of the world that contains deep, dark secrets. It softens our fears of danger, darkness and destruction, and removes the electrical charge from what we perceive as ‘scary’. MAGNIFIES: Facing fears, emotional purification, transforming the underbelly, ability to look at parts of oneself that are scary, sense of safety, interconnectedness, feeling of being free of expectations DISSOLVES: Anger; anguish; frustration from a variety of causes; shyness; kind of unseen; fear of speaking out, saying the wrong thing, being judged USE: Enjoy 5 drops sublingually 5 times each day regularly until bottle is finished; or put a dropperful in your water bottle each morning and drink throughout the day.

Uprooting the Past After just a few days of using this elixir, there was no doubt that a shift of things from my past was being brought to the surface to be healed and released. I could literally feel energy, emotions, and thoughts making their way from my lower chakras up to my throat. It has shown me exactly where there are other blockages that need healing and have made it incredibly clear which areas of my life are blocked, too. Using other Lotus Wei essences to help this process has been extra helpful! C CM Deep Support to Ease a Challenging Time I was powerfully drawn to this elixir at a time when I was working through some challenges, some repressed memories that were very hard to face or speak about.  This elixir called to me so strongly, I felt I couldn’t not take it.  I had some heavy news I couldn’t bring myself to share that weighed heavily on me.  After taking this elixir for a short while taking this elixir, this news just “fell out” spontaneously.  I just blurted it out, spontaneously.  I really believe it helped make my deepest fears less scary and so much easier to manage.  It helped me release and let go of so much, allowing me such a sense of freedom, liberation and love.  It was truly a wonderful support at the perfect time.  Thank you, I feel so much lighter with the help of this flower. R Robyn Powerful elixir Using purple wishbone with fierce compassion. I am amazed at what has come up, a lot of emotional purification of very old wounds that were unconscious and profoundly impacting me in my life. I am so grateful for this elixir. I am being able to face things that have been repressed, things that were overwhelming, frightening, felt too threatening."

A divinely-scented orchid in the shape of an angel, the Radiance Orchid was collected in northern Costa Rica on a full moon. It teaches us how to release tension and resistance around loss. It dissolves fear of getting hurt, missing out on something or separation/abandonment. When we let go of denial or fighting reality, we experience total acceptance of the way things are -- without grasping or clinging. This flower essence helps us release money worries, relationship angst, and sadness in the grief/loss process, while magnifying an embodied state of love. We experience deep relief and a wildness to truly be ourselves, supported by a visceral sense of our own spiritual nature.

Loving Awareness I have had reoccurring feelings of hopelessness, separation from loved ones, and worry about my path. It is like this deep heavy grief in my chest and lungs. Since taking Radiance Orchid and spending time with it in nature, I have felt the heaviness lift and be replaced with a deep easeful acceptance. It has helped me to be more aware of the love and guidance that surrounds us all the time, and to soften into that support. It truly feels like being in the presence of an angel. Thank you! S S.H.D. Amazing! High vibrational. I felt the difference right away. C Corley M. All is Well While taking this, I felt a profound sense of peace and connection to all that is. I felt a pervasive sense of peace and “all is well” with whatever arose and different individuals.  I felt as though it helped to dissolve illusions of seperation that manifest as suffering in my life through different areas - relationships, my work and day to day challenges that arose.  I felt supported in navigating them with a deep trust in things unfolding in highest good. C Charlotte P. Realism I found radiance orchid really puts you in the NOW which can feel uncomfortable if you are used to existing in fantasies of the future or regrets of the past. Now I feel focused on the present moment, however messy or uncomfortable and open to infinite possibilities before me. Also, I have had a very full schedule of dreams like my body is processing and clearing all that stops me from being in the now- nothing nasty or unpleasant more like a clear out of junk you don’t want in your closet. D Daniela B. Can't get enough of this, one of my favorites! Wow, I was sweapt away by this flower, I felt super drawn to it and it has a really strong effect on me too, sort of like making me melt and surrender, it makes everything so much easier.... processing emotions especially, I would say if we are in strong resistance to certain situations we're facing this is perfect, it really helped to process things more effortlessly, and calming my nervous system and taking the edge of triggers, so I feel like it's a great companion in general in these times...  I felt like I wanted to bathe in it really, I kept taking it so often that I was done with the bottle within barely 3 weeks, and I'm gonna get another one, which I've never done before I think, but I seem to need this, really grateful I found it. :)"

Intense experience I used the essence, mist and anointing oil and it was an intense experience. So many things surfaced during this first month of use. A lot of family and ancestral stuff came up. It was intense emotionally. When I was in the experience that wasn't fun at all but looking back I always wished for feeling more of my emotions and this did happen. I felt more and was much more emotionally expressive which is really a big step for me. The scent grew on me over time and by now I really like it. It is strange how these things can shift over time. S S Y. One of the reviewers described how they experienced emotional rolling contractions in the first couple of days, which I experienced too in addition to feeling physically constricted in the heart space. So many things surfaced, but after the first few days a certain lightness emerged, and I found it easier to resolve issues with compassion rather than apathy or avoidance. E Esther B. Open heart anointing oil Love it. Good luck ALWAYS comes my way when I wear any of these essences. Coincidence? Methinks not! :) J Jennifer K. Winning combination As recommended by something Katie wrote, I decided to try a combination of Open Heart oil, Fierce Compassion mist, and Infinite Love elixir to use simultaneously every day. I was not initially a huge fan of the Open Heart smell but it quickly grew on me. The combination of the three was a huge support to my intention of developing more self-compassion and self-love. I could tell when I forgot to use them. I was disappointed when they were done - must  be time to order more! I recommend trying the combo, or another combo that she mentioned. C Coleen C. Uplifiting I love the Open Heart oil. It has a soft spicy, floral scent that invigorates and uplifts! It's my go to when I am feeling heavy in my chest. E Elizabeth H. soft & sweet This anointing oil is soft & sweet- I found it to be a powdery floral- very similar to Expansive Presence. Like some others, I was not sure about the scent at first but I have come to enjoy it (& gifted Expansive Presence to my mom since they were so similar- to me). S Sarah M. Initially I did not like this scent, but after a few weeks it grew on me and now I really like it! The scent is kind of cozy. I put it on when my heart feels closed. K Kateri v.H. Ambrosia for the spirit I have been a loyal Infinite Love annointer for quite a while now. I tried Fierce Compassion, and it’s very nice, but nowhere near as wonderful for me as Infinite Love....but this new one, Open Heart. Wow. I cannot describe what it smells like, but it’s fruity and luscious and just opens my senses right up. I feel softer. Takes the edge off when I get over anxious. I love it. So much. E Eveline A. Bouquet of flowers that grow on you I am not sure what the fragrance of this oil reminds me of, but I love it, smells familiar and nostalgic. To me, it’s unisex, uplifting and refreshing. This and Truth Teller oils have been my go to when I need a pick me up at work. T Timothy S. Smells very interesting! At first this scent was very strange!! It took a few weeks to grow on me.. But now I love it! Same thing happened for me with the Fierce Compassion and Wild Abundance oils! However, Anyone I've asked to smell and give their opinion says they all smell amazing. I had to purchase the elixir after getting this! I've been really enjoying them together. Excellent product as always! :) Love the dropper bottle!!"

I recently tried the open heart serum and love it.  The scent is light, it absorbs really quickly.  I’ve come to really love using a serum.  I have been doing very deep healing work and at one point was dissociated and having a hard time staying grounded.  I’ve found using serums and the  loving, nourishing sensory act of rubbing the serum over my heart space to be powerful.  The essences in it are powerful, I’ve had many deep patterns surfaces and have found myself feeling safer to open more fully and be vulnerable with others.  This has been a wonderful support for my healing. I had some intense memories surface that I’ve been healing, in addition to navigating these tumultuous times and LOTUSWEI flower essences including this Open Heart serum have been a tremendous support in my healing and moving towards thriving. J Jen M Beautiful spray! Open Heart is just a beautiful experience!  When I spray the mist around me, I can feel my body relaxing and opening up.  The scent is amazing and unique to the other flower essences, and I keep it next to my sink in the bathroom so I can spray it around me throughout the day.  This one is, by far, my favorite! A A. Sigh of relief Using this serum is a wave of fresh air, easing the tightness of less wonderful emotions and helps to allow them to move freely up and out. J Jodi Walker Open Heart I really loved open heart. I was working on something from my past and it really helped it come up and release and I felt my heart soften.  I will use this again as I feel there are more layers and it worked quite well for me.   Really love Lotus Wei and what you are doing with flowers around the world :) C C. Moore Supporting my choice :) Waking relaxed, flowing through the day, a bath of soothing luxury this is how Open Heart mist, serum, elixir and serum are doing for me.  I chose to be laid back and Open Heart is helping me do that.  :) 1 2"

Love all the products We appreciate the love and support! m m.l. Absolutely love anything from this company especially the aura sprays. It shifts my energy in a such a good way. Love it J Justina M. Subtle yet noticeable I spray this before meditation and it inspires a tender feeling towards life L L.R. Unexpected scent — centering result I have deeply enjoyed the combo of this mist plus the companion elixir. I came to Open Heart (or rather it came to me, thank you divine timing via an Instagram giveaway!) with a lot of ungrounded energy and tender/teary/looking to the past-ness. I was just a few weeks in at my new house and fresh off a bit of the holiday blues (first holiday season since breaking up). This Open Heart mist and elixir combo have allowed me to be with grief and tenderness in a non-overwhelming way. I felt totally rooted and capable to navigate whatever showed up as it showed up and no longer fearful of big feelings arising. I feel more peaceful and in my body. I am grateful to and for this flower magic. Now I’ll admit the scent is different than anything I’ve smelled before. It’s not bad, simply unfamiliar and took a little getting used to but it did grow on me (think it’s the cardamom!). As I’m wrapping up the Elixir, I’m grateful to still have the Open Heart energy with this mist to transition with me to the True Strength elixir. T Timothy S. More energy I've noticed since adding this line to my routine I've been feeling more energetic when waking up and so much calmer, Like it's really helped relax my anxiety. Smells really lovely too! I love to mist myself at my job in between customers. I love the elixir and anointing oil as well!! It would be so cool if you could sell incense as well k kelly s. it's growing on me I wonder if this particular essence blend has been somewhat challenging for me based on the fact that I'm pretty ""closed off"" in general, and despite consciously working on this aspect of myself for the past year or so, I'm continually discovering old patterning and deep-seated beliefs that contribute to this recurring behavior. There have been breakthroughs, leading to powerful states of open-heartedness that felt very transformative, though that state of being never quite ""stuck."" Maybe it's not supposed to; maybe being in that state all the time could be problematic, at least for me... Whatever the case, I enjoy the feeling and have been chasing after it through various methods, most recently through this aptly-named flower essence blend. I'll write about the elixir in a separate review -- as for the mist, my initial reaction to the scent was ""yuck."" It had an undertone that I would describe as ""dirty,"" like wet laundry that sat around too long after you forgot to put it in the dryer. This, I would later discover, was the cardamom, which was initially overpowering to my nose (I used a cardamom essential oil recently and it had the same scent profile). Likewise, the way I seemed to emotionally/energetically react to the blend itself was a bit yucky: I felt sort of grumpy, perhaps even more closed off than before, or at least more openly critical of myself and others. The tricky astrological timing that coincided with my experimenting might've factored into this. But it wasn't what I was expecting, to say the least. I then went back and re-watched Katie's video post and read others' reviews, and decided to try pairing the mist/elixir with Infinite Love mist/elixir, which I happened to have on hand (i.e. taking them simultaneously). This definitely seemed to soften the impact. Over time, I have come to appreciate the scent of the mist in a new way, and it's grown on me to the point that I now salivate a bit when I encounter it. The underlying sweetness has opened up for me and the ""dirtiness"" has dissipated, or at least taken on a new association; what once was off-putting has become charming. It lingers on my skin not like mildewy wash water, but like a secret that wants to be shared (not ""stay away from me,"" but ""come closer""). I've noticed subtle shifts in my behavior, more likely to make light-hearted jokes about my own bad habits and call myself out on them in a compassionate way. Self-discovery comes easily and without much (if any) accompanying ""heaviness"" in the process. Feeling pretty transparent in my interactions with others, and absolutely okay with that. It's like the characteristic ""storm clouds"" that usually follow me around have parted, and I'm feeling sunlight on my back now, instead. I still haven't ventured to try the Open Heart solo (sans Infinite Love) after my initial experience, but I'm now considering doing so. It's been well over a month. Now that I can appreciate the scent by itself, I think I can handle the effects on their own without my Infinite Love security blanket. I'll follow up with a review of the elixir after trying this out for awhile. m marietta m. magical Open Heart! Open Heart Aura Mist is magical for me. I have been going thru depressing time of my life (turning 69yo, retiring from nursing, moving, masking...etc) First day with Open Heart I felt ""worry"" energies dissolving.I spray it whenever I need to uplift my spirit.  I don't know how it worked but for me it just makes me feel happier. and the fragrance is Divine! thank you Katie for sharing your beautiful gifts with the planet. C Carolina C. Peck peck weekly breaking out of a shell. First, the spray bottle didn’t spray so I had to mix it with one I had with Wild and Beautiful spray from a local. Then I sprayed every day. Two to three weeks later, I started to get results. I’ve been isolated and the sight of another person makes me cough. The cough subsided. It has been difficult to turn my frown upside down. Now it’s easier. I used to want and expect other people to validate my existence. It took a while. The results are emerging. I am grateful. The people in my family hopefully will notice. 💕💪🏽✅ M Monica Delicious Blend! I really love the Open Heart Mist! There's something about the cedar-lemony aroma that brings me back to Nature. It's uplifting and warming at the same time. R Renee N. My New Favorite Open Heart mist is my new favorite. There is something warm, inviting and calming about Open Heart, and the scent is lovely. Some people have said I come across aloof, and I do not want to come across that way. After using the mist 3 days, I noticed a difference. I am not as guarded. I actually felt more open and comfortable in my relationships with others. Thank you! 1 2"

I have been feeling really closed off to life, and to loved ones and have been protecting my heart. When I use this elixir, something softens and I feel as though I am able to access my emotions, rather than keep them hidden. I have been experiencing a lot of grief and sadness, and this allowed me to feel more tender, rather than keep my heart closed. So beautiful. K K.M. Heart center I love using this elixir and then tuning into my heart space. I have been cultivating heart centered living and find this product to be supportive on this journey. S Susan Heart Opening The first week was rough. Old negative thoughts and emotions came out. Feelings and emotions under the surface that were not being expressed. They felt too overwhelming to express. I judged that no one would understand. Open Heart helped me stay present and grounded in emotional conversations with loved ones. I noticed my pattern of avoiding emotional topics and feelings. I do not like feeling vulnerable. Open Heart reminded me that it is safe to have my heart open.  It worked. Relationships have deepened and it is liberating.  I have a greater inner devotion to myself and my needs. It feels okay to do what I want rather than what ""I should."" Great stuff! Thank you, Lotus Wei! M M.Z. Opened my ❤️ Once again Lotus Wei has made a beautiful powerful elixer that expands & softens your heart… I definitely had a bit of a mild healing crises with this.

Open heart ❤️ I found it a lot easier to express from the heart and felt less anxious like I could focus in on committing my heart to one thing at a time fully rather than diluting my heart energy to protect myself. I’ve always worn my heart on my sleeve, but this brought it to new dimensions. I really appreciate the openness and softness it brought A Anonymous Open hearted miracles - a vertical I have been working on opening my heart because of some hard years, and when I saw the Open Heart elixir, I knew it would be helpful.  I use Joy Juice as a foundation for my life (the anointing oil) and found that Joy Juice with the Open Heart elixir, aided by Icelandic Moss elixir (to add some more playful energy)--combined together as a vertical--helped me to have a bubbly/playful/light energy that really aided in my heart opening.  A gorgeous experience that has helped me transition into my next chapter in unexpected ways.  As always, thank you to Katie & the Lotus Wei crew <3 I also have the mist and anointing oil for Open Heart, and it is a warming, spicy fragrance that feels grandmotherly (without at all smelling like a pie)  ;)  I adore it. A Ashley L. Softened the walls around my Heart I'd been through a number of challenging situations that caused me to lose trust and shut myself off from others. When I realized this, I immediately came to Lotuswei to find an elixir to help me reconnect with myself and others again, and WOW...Open Heart has really come through!! I could feel and see the effects almost instantly, but also have appreciated the continued journey it's been taking me on. I'm less fearful about feeling my emotions and am able to actually sit with them. And that's helping me to shift my perspective on my relationships and be more open to connecting with others again.

Smells amazing and I feel great when wearing it! C Caroline Clearly need this as I found I already have a bottle so using it now. S S.H. I just received this product and was so excited given all the rave reviews about this product's scent, however found myself feeling kind of nauseous and light-headed from it. It's disappointing considering how I usually LOVE the smell of all the individual ingredients in this product and have loved the scents of all the other lotuswei products I've tried but for some reason I can't get past the smell of this concoction. I'm going to try to stick it out for it's benefits but not sure how i'll tolerate this smell 5x/day. Thank you for your honest feedback on our Luscious Embodiment Anointing Oil. We're sorry to hear that you experienced some discomfort with the scent. We understand how scent is very much about individual taste. Anointing Oils have the most potent scent because they were pioneered to replace conventional perfumes so they are meant to be quite strong! So only a drop is needed at a time :) Feel free to dilute it down to dilute the scent - we recommend diluting with Jojoba Oil. We hope this helps. We recommend giving the product a bit more time to adjust to your senses and see if the benefits outweigh the scent for you - also we recommend you try the Luscious Embodiment Mist, as the scent is much lighter! xoxo N N.L. Obsessed I bought this oil for the first time at an event, and my focus immediately shifted from being scattered in the busyness of the event, to being completely immersed in myself and with whoever I was engaged with. I'm usually really nervous going to events like that alone, but something about having an anointing oil on me made me feel protected and confident. I have purchased it twice since! J J.J. YUM This oil smells SO gloriously good. The scent is rich, intoxicating and luxurious. I can't stop smelling my wrists while I have this on - so delicious! If this one is calling to you, GET IT - it's such a treat! K K.C. EXPANSIVE This oil, this scent... it's like nothing else I have ever smelled in my life. It is my favorite scent. The smell is captivating, beautiful, sensual...a really special product. M Monica V. Exquisite oil! What a beautiful oil! I LOVE using it. The scent is transcending and every time I wear it I feel exquisite, grounded, and even more feminine.  When I have it on, I notice people are drawn to me.  On a couple of occasions, people have asked what I am wearing and it was as though they were slightly hypnotized by the subtle linger of the oil on me - I'm telling you, this oil is magical!!  I even had one person at the store tell me the scent from my oil put her in a very comforting mood. This scent is a gentle reminder for me to slow down and stay soft with a boost of confidence! A Ann W. Balanced and delightful This product is miles bettter than other such things sold onlline.  Well balanced and delightful, it is a pleasure to wear and experience during the day, as is the ""Wild Abundance"". E Ei M.H. Magical Been using this for two weeks and loving it. The scent is subtle yet magical. It gives you very spa like vibe and I use every night before bed for better luxurious sleep. In day time, or whenever stressed at work, I use it with the intention to remind myself the importance of being in present and lusciousness of every moment . L Laurie S. Perfect timing! I love synchronicity! I noticed the email about the Chinese New Year & opened it up. I’d been feeling like I was missing flowers in my life, so when I read my Chinese zodiac of Dragon was all about Luscious Embodiment, filled with florals a d blue (my favorite color!), everything inside of me said I needed this! It’s so rich in scent & calming to wear. I highly recommend this company’s amazing products! 1 2"

Wonderful! I originally bought this mist in its smaller size, but I loved it so much that I used it up too fast! So, I had to go back and get the bigger bottle! It smells wonderful, but I am a sucker for ylang ylang. It's fruity and refreshing and it's just perfect for those moments where you need a little bit of grounding into your power and body. I highly recomend! A Alexxis A. The most amazing!! These flower mists have improved my life in more ways than one. It’s hard to explain the benefit from these mists without trying them. They automatically go to work the minute they leave the bottle and really truly improve my mood. They make me feel lighter, happier, and more engaged. I Highly recommend to anyone! Pure flower magic ✨ S S.G. I am here! I received this mist as a gift from a dear friend.  She knew what I had been through and all of the work that I have done to heal.  You see several years ago, I had a significant emotional event that left me feeling disconnected from my body.  I didn't feel safe.  After a lot of work and creating a safe environment for myself, and I was still struggling to live inside of my body.  This Lucious Embodiment Mist was exactly what I needed to help change the energy of my aura and integrate all of the work that I had done.  For the first time in a long time, I am so happy to live in my body.  I am here!  I am so excited to be alive! T Tiffani S. Definitely luscious! I would use this mist again. My daughters and I loved the scent and I enjoyed this mist through out the day. It helped me be more present on zoom calls. I this used along side Truthteller and I believe Inner Knowing and I really felt it helped me with putting myself out there for my business. M Monique H. WOW I've only just opened this package, after doing my uncontrollable Lotuswei package dance, and while I knew I was drawn to this mix this time, I did NOT expect how badly I needed it. I bought this one and the Expansive Presence mist, and sprayed the other first, which was lush, but then I impulsively followed up with a spray of this mist and WOW.  I cannot express what just happened - I think my solar plexus chakra just opened as I started giggling uncontrollably and the bottom right hand side of my back is tingling like I'm being tickled and it hasn't stopped for the last five minutes.  This is odd also, as I had an extremely damaged back in the last month in almost the same spot.  I feel like I dance a ballet right now, or do cartwheels or go running down the road.  Not sure if it was the mix of the two, but this one hit me instantly and I was in a terrible mood all day until this box arrived (it even altered the mood of the postman, who was ridiculously happy when I collected it from him, but I doubt he knows why!). Think this might have to be a repeat purchase.  I kind of feel like drowning myself in a bath of this mix, and having the elixir at the same time.  If you're drawn to this one, would a thousand percent recommend.  It's strong.  My whole back is tingling.  I can't wait to see what happens after a few days on this cocktail. Oh, and the smell is delicious.  I use these essences for manifesting, as I find that it helps to keep a steady mental diet/focus on desires when you're spraying something this high energy on you 5x a day, as you'll remember to do it consistently, and that speeds manifestation as you're strengthening your focus in the direction you want to move. As always, thanks again Lotuswei.  You were the best thing I ever stumbled across, luckily through a video mention from one of Holistichabits videos, I recommend you to everyone. L Lisa M. So Lovely I'm taking a juicy cocktail of Lotus Wei products and this has been such a subtle and powerful force for me. I've been setting boundaries I've struggled to set my whole life. It's a little challenging to feel beautiful deep in quarantine and in Minnesota winter. This little mist has helped me start to feel myself and open up more of my sensuality, even despite the circumstances. To me smells like it has a hint of anise (although I know that's not even in this!) Maybe it's the ylang ylang, which I also love. C Carla S. Great! I love using the mists! They're so refreshing and make me feel so good! This one is no exception! It's great!"

Highly recommend. Hey Joanne! Wonderful, thank you for your feedback :) xoxo J Joanne Love the elixirs I have used very often and love the whole range. Choose what you need and stick at it, can use more often than 5 times a day if needed. These are the best ever flower essences!! C C.S. Hi everyone, this beautiful elixir has helped me in so many different ways... from over coming sexual abuse trauma to feeling closed from the world. Now I am open to life experiences effortlessly and embody my own beauty. I am an aquarius woman so being different is my norm, but not always easy to except. This elixir helps me embrace my uniqueness easily. Would recommend to anyone wanting to set healthy boundaries and wanting to embrace their own beautiful soul to be free and wild - within their own skin. Thank you Catherine J J.W. Helps with boundaries and being myself I am working  with this one currently around boundaries. I’ve always been the person everyone tells their personal stories to. This one keeps me open but still aware enough to not take on other peoples energetic stuff. It reminds me we all have to do our own inner work and it helps others understand that too with good solid communication and boundaries. Love this one ! K Kim K. Lovely This is my second time trying an elixir and I’ve definitely had better results with it since I started taking it topically instead of in water. For me it’s a nice boost in the day that I would usually try and find elsewhere, sometimes with less healthy things. So this makes for a great replacement! E E.A. A truly embodied experience! I've been using Lotus Wei since back when there were only 6 blends and nothing else. I've taken all 6 stabilization blends and at least half of the others, and. have found this one to be the best fit for me. I had some huge shifts thee month I was taking this, and felt much more grounded and in by body. If you're like me and struggle with feeling floaty and a bit dissociated sometimes, this elixir will be your best friend! K Kelly T. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE my psychedelic psychologist recommended this to me and I absolutely love it, it's made me feel so lovely and in touch with myself. 10/10 love. K K.C. Favorite This is probably my favorite essence. It helps you feel connected to your divine feminine, sensuality and beauty. A A.B. Body Joy! Day 3! I had to write to say Thank You for this epic Elixir...I have been dancing up a storm every time I use this elixir and it is only day 3 :) Also, have experienced more depth and silence when sitting to drop in and meditate...Blessed Be! When I first read about this elixir some time ago, I was afraid...and recently she said it was time and I would have the strength and support to move through whatever came up so I have been more than pleasantly surprised by all the free energy that just wants to move! So thankful, bless you all! B Brittini H. I’ve taken flower essences for years and always felt a difference and even the most subtle shift in energy. However, I’ve taken this elixir consistently for the last 2 weeks and haven’t noticed a difference as of yet, which I found pretty surprising after having taken the flower quiz. It was spot on for me. I will continue taking the elixir until I finish the bottle, but will likely not purchase again. Hi Brittini Thank you for your feedback :) I wanted to reach out and help you - I am sorry to hear you are feeling like you are not noticing a difference with the Luscious Embodiment elixir. Can you give me an update as we progress into a new week? I really feel like it is working layer by layer and because every body has their own individual experience with a flower essence, the length of time it can take varies. I can tell you from my experience, I have felt that way initially with some flower essences. So I really do understand your situation. I had this experience with Inner Knowing --- but after sticking with it when the 3rd week of use was over, I began to notice major shifts. I wondered if they were going to come or not prior to this! But after working with LOTUSWEI essences for 6 years, I trusted in the process. I had a lot deep-seated patterns/blockages that were slowly being worked through. After the third week they rose to the surface - and were very noticeable for me. This helped me to confront and release them. I really believe this could be what is happening here with the Luscious Embodiment Brittini --- I would absolutely encourage you to keep me updated on this. These things can take their time to work through. Sometimes it could indicate you need to devote more time to this blend - I have worked with Infinite Love, for example, for over 6 months! I definitely needed more self-love! Let me know your thoughts on all of this. Have you ever tried the Luscious Embodiment mist or anointing oil? Happy to assist you xoxo Lyndsey 1 2 3"

A beautiful accessory To know the feeling of spaciousness as the culmination of my work to gracefully move beyond the obstacles was so subtle, so quick, so easy to overlook.  Luscious Embodiment did that. Love it's magic. Grateful for your beautiful experience! T T.C. So luscious in all the ways This one is just yummy yum yum! Even just thinking about it gets me all tingly and excited. I love how gentle, soft, and light the scent is, and the hint of blue in the oil takes the luxuriousness to another level. Such a treat! Here's to treating yourself with the greatest of care! xo A Amy C. Putting the pleasure in the journey As someone who has experienced their healing journey as painful, over processed, and never ending, basically someone trapped in the spiritual ego, the Lotuswei products have become the bridge to embodiment. There was such a powerful nudge to trust the product, Katie's teachings and the community.  I started using the products in fun and pleasurable ways-in my EFT tapping practice, Energy medicine routines and general play.  None of that seemed possible before I decided to blindly trust the offerings, devoting myself to not learning about how they worked, instead just implementing them in both ritualized and playful ways. It is my mission to introduce this plant knowledge to as many as possible. Hi Amy! Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with our Luscious Embodiment Serum. We are thrilled to hear that it has brought pleasure and improved your healing journey. Trusting the product, Katie's teachings, and our community is key to achieving embodiment, and we are grateful for your devotion. We are glad to hear that you have found creative and enjoyable ways to incorporate the serum into your daily routine. It is our mission to spread the power of plant knowledge, and we appreciate your support in helping us reach more people. Thank you again for your kind words and for being a part of our community. xoxo L L.L. The good mood serum I love using luscious embodiment serum at night on my feet. I wake up feeling relaxed, happy, sensual, beautiful. It’s a great way to wake in the morning, to appreciate yourself and the magic in the world. J JJ Such a treat! I am in love with this serum, the scent, the feel on my skin and how it makes me feel inside. I use it after I shower and just bought the anointing oil so I can keep using it throughout the day. It smells so good. Gentle and soothing but so luxurious. I don't have many serums so maybe they are all this good. If you find yourself drawn to it take it as a hint. D Dominique B. amazing <3 This is probably my favorite item from Lotus Wei right now! I love to put it on my feet at night, but it's great to apply anywhere. I use it often instead of the anointing oil because I tend to really like the lighter scents of the serums :) Using it before sleep gives me insightful, vivid, creative, sexy, beautiful, enjoyable dreams~ I can't even express how awesome my whole experience is with this serum! It's been amazing as I navigate self-healing. Truly, the flowers in Luscious Embodiment really speak to me me, and to what I need. I am so thankful to Katie for formulating this incredible blend! I'll always have all of the Luscious Embodiment products on hand <3 C Chelsey G. Juicy and affectionate I've been using this serum at least 5x a day for the last three weeks, and I've noticed such a fascinating shift in my relationship with my boyfriend... Usually I'm stuck in work mode and have a hard time dropping into a more soft, affectionate headspace when I'm with him. Since using this serum, I've noticed a real shift in our relationship. I feel so much more soft, juicy, and feminine around him, and he's really noticed the difference too! J Jessica C. Quick Results, Incredibly effective I ordered the Luscious Embodiment serum because I recently realized just how disconnected from my body I am.  Specifically concerning to me was my disconnect from physical pleasure.  That's not me but I figured it was an unfortunate side effect of being a full time mom and having a tiny human attached me to all the time.  I wanted to create a ritual that helped ground me back in me but in a way that helped me connect back to my sensuality.  The serum seemed like the obvious choice since it would add the element of physical touch.  I've been using the serum for about a week and a half 3-5 times a day.  I'll apply to my face, neck, shoulders & even sometimes to my underams after a shower.  At first I felt some friction come up.  Can't put my finger on what, just knew something was unwinding.  Then, a couple of days ago, I felt this breakthrough.  I feel more embodied and connected to me.  My husband is noticing a difference and when we had a moment to sneak off for some alone time fun, I didn't shy away are come up with some lame excuse about laundry.  I jumped & we had an incredible experience.  I'm not a different person or anything, just more me.  Less stiff, uptight, dissatisfied.  I'm in love!  This is the first serum I've ordered and I have to say I love the formulation.  It is light enough for me to use in my hair (it's fine and just about everything weighs it down) and my skin loves how quickly it absorbs."

Grateful for you sharing your expereince! C Corley M. Refreshing I love using serum and enjoy this one in particular.  It smells like a walk in the woods and is so refreshing.  Using serum is very grounding and connects me to my body.  At night, I massage it on the soles of my feet or any other part of my body and set my intention for the following day. Inner Knowing specifically has been helpful to slow my worrying mind.  I have trust and know little by little in what is a right step to move toward my bigger goals.

The four-month span is in itself different from my experience with other flower essences, where I would diligently finish a bottle within a month. It’s almost like this bottle has asked me to only reach for it when I felt called to— teaching me how to reconnect to my inner knowing. I am now using it « as prescribed », if not more so.. and it has been interesting to arrive here more naturally; through intuition and being connected to myself, rather than through discipline or logic. It’s so remarkable to me! The process of taking five drops/five times a day is the same whether by discipline or by ‘inner knowing’, but the latter, at least for right now, is leaving room for insight and inspiration. And the effects of taking the drops are becoming more noticeable, almost by the day. This too is different from past experiences in which I felt the greatest impact or shift in the first days of beginning an essence. I can’t remember now what exactly I had hoped to get out of this but I imagine that it was a very definite and clear sense of ‘what I should do next’, and while I won’t say that I have been awarded answers, it no longer feels an issue. I am none the more ‘clearer’ but I have a blind trust that the earth will be where my next step lands. Even, that this blind trusting is necessary and beautiful. Thank you for sharing your experience with Inner Knowing! We are so glad to hear that it has been teaching you how to reconnect with your inner knowing :) It's wonderful to see how it has helped you to arrive at a place of insight and inspiration. We are happy to hear that the effects are becoming more noticeable for you as well. We hope that it continues to bring you the blind trust and clarity that you need. Thank you for your support! xoxo A A.D. Encourages Self Trust Of all the aspect this flower elixir magnifies, perhaps the two I noticed the most was wild expansion and the ""I can achieve whatever I want"" sense of confidence. Even if I felt a wobble in my ability to follow through on my inner knowing, this flower essence helped me remain steady during a period of tremendous growth and deep personal work. I no longer felt off track or lost, and instead experienced a sense of self trust and certainty return after a long hiatus. This is a lovely choice for remaining steadfastly connected to you inner voice. A A.T. Finding a Truthful Path I was actually finding it difficult to just trust in my current journey, and I found myself overwhelmed with this mental fog. This essence in addition to the meditations were really helpful in just trusting and listening to the voice in my heart and surrendering to the steps I was already taking instead of being influenced by self doubt and fear. R Robyn R. Inner knowing, inner strength… This elixir has helped me with self trust, inner peace and strength, not taking things personally, and courage for authentic expression. C C.H. This elixir gives me a boost of self trust every time I take it. It also helps me to look within to get in touch with peace and calmness that is always with me. It also gives me the confidence to learn different art techniques that I am not formally trained in. A wonderful elixir. Thank you! N N.S. Self-trust and clarity This has definitely helped me access and trust an inner knowing. I've been able to gain clarity in some areas that have been cloudy and stuck for a long time. K Kelsey G. Amazingggg! I can’t believe the difference I have noticed in just a few weeks. Truly amazing M Melanie F. Heightened Intuition The Inner Knowing Elixir has increased my intuitive abilities very quickly. My mother told me the other day that I had “read her mind”! I’m also feeling things very deeply and feel much more in tune. This flower elixir is amazing! D D.P. Subtle waves of peace I really enjoyed this elixir. I felt like it turned a lot of beliefs I had upside down, and brought in subtle waves of peace. Beautiful. A Angela T. Took a step into the unknown with peace I've been using the elixir and the mist every time I walk past the bottles and not realizing how powerful they are until now. I made a significant career change that shocked everyone around me but me. Peace, confidence, and a strong inner knowing that this was the right choice for me never wavered despite many well intent opinions. I don't know what the future holds but I remain calm and open to new miracles. I strongly believe this essence gave me the strength to listen to myself with confidence. 1 2 3"

Earthy - Grounding I love the earthy smell of the inner knowing. It is so grounding and calming. Reminds me of just being in a forest next to spruce and fresh plants. Love it! A A.W. Magically just what I need... I have a deep love for woody scents, especially cedar and sandalwood - they remind me of the enchanted forests and ancient trees of my soul landscape. This gorgeous, woodsy, warm scent couldn't be more magically perfect right now as I'm on the cusp of making some very important decisions to relocate to a deeply forested area from a dry, barren one. That it has the very scents I always crave and flower essences I need is serendipitous.

Incredible and immediate results This elixir is definitely one of my favorites! I sometimes have an issue being direct with people, especially at work. I also have an issue finding the right word when I'm trying to explain something. This elixir has completely helped with all of this. I find that I am more articulate, direct, focused, and I get to the point faster. I was actually so impressed by this elixir I wanted to find the flower to buy and keep at my house! This is one little hidden gem that I found on the site and so happy that I did. C CM Powerful This elixir was profoundly powerful and revealed to me how I needed to “restructure” my ways of being so that my speech actions and way of being was most aligned with my highest good.  When I first started it, I was burning with energy and focus.  Some interesting observations were that I found extraneous drama in my day because instead of ambiguity in my intentions, thoughts, focus and speech was others, I was clearly and directly focused.  As an example, I found less arguing with my kids getting ready for school in mornings as rather then responding to behaviour I was proactively direct and clear which eliminated the need. In general, I was direct,   clear and focused, and therefore more deliberate, less distracted and more intentional throughout my day. I initially thought while taking this elixir, I would eliminate my to do list, completing all my outstanding tasks. However, interestingly, my priorities were “shaken up” and I gained clarity on what was priority, where I needed boudaries and space for my effectiveness in executing intentions, and for my well-being. Overall, I realized that my lack of structure and clear intentional focus (at macro level) resulted in chaos with my efforts and energy less contained.  I feel this elixir highlighted and supported me in adding some masculine energy to contain the otherwise chaotic flow of creative energy so that it could be more effectively contained and directed. I highly recommend this elixir."

Top notch All of LotusWei’s products are infused with integrity and healing. I have loved every product I’ve tried so far. The aura mists are a great way to come back to my intention and ‘cleanse the moment.’ 'Cleanse the moment' ~ LOVE that! :) A Ann Y. Doubted its power The mists are wonderful in general.  I tried the inner knowing mist because the elixir was too strong for me. The smell is clean and I immediately feel calmer.  I enjoy the fragrance as well. J Jennifer L. Awesome mist I absolutely have started being more in touch with my Inner Knowing, with this mist! It helps me to remember each time I use it to center myself and come out of ego! I will definitely be purchasing from LotusWei again and again! :) Thank you for all that you've done to help the world align with Source! I hope one day to attend one of your retreats! Love the mission and the energy behind this! <3 H H.D. Lots of Clarity I love this mist! The woodsy smell is wonderful. I was drawn to this during pregnancy as I was looking for flower essence support to help me with my transition to motherhood. Within the first two days of taking it I gained awareness around how I’d been denying/stuffing feelings of scarcity and fear of not enough money, especially  with all the expenses that come along with bringing in this new life. I added in the Wild Abundance elixir and within another 2 days my whole perspective began to change and I felt those anxious feelings about lack simply start to melt away! I started keeping a log of all of the different ways money was flowing into my life and was SHOCKED to find 1) all of the abundance that was already surrounding me in life and 2) how much more abundance started flowing in by taking the time to truly be grateful for what was already here! C Corley M. Centring I love this mist. For some time, I have been off centre, agitated and not trusting or possibly not attuned to my clear intuition.  This mist has been a lifesaver, helping me to anchor within my centre.  The scent is so refreshing and misting it is an instant reset.  I feel less striving and grasping for my “knowing” and more sense of trust in my knowing unfolding and arising from within. Very helpful in helping me realign with my inner wisdom. D D.B. Always helpful when you feel unsure or stuck I haven't used this one yet fully consecutively yet, but more so every time I feel unsure about something or stuck in some way, it has never failed to lead to some breakthrough or the next step being revealed... much clearer vision and turn arounds... therefore it is one of my favorite go to's when needed! And I seem to be highly responsive to this one as well, because I don't need much, if I use it before bed it'll do the trick. I've also been a huge fan of shell ginger when I used that as a single elixir years ago, really helped to be tapped into the positive momentum, I think that one alone helps to get new throught going. :) K K.A. Trust Creates Effortlessness This blend is powerful but snuck up on me slowly, a different feeling from the other blends. I wasn't sure what I felt until about a week in when I realized I felt a deep sense of self trust that i didnt even know wasn't there before. Leaning into the support of this trust put me at ease instead of feeling pressure to force things forward and now it feels easy to let things unfold effortlessly. I feel everything it says in the ""dissolves"" section! I feel like I am finally moving past some very deep lifelong blocks, thank you for thjs! S Susan Inner Knowing Mist Inner Knowing Mist feels like a shower of warm sparkling sunshine.I t has given me a sense of inner knowing that my direction is the right direction for me.  It loosens the hold of the outside world on my decision making. I love the sweet earthy fragrance. I am pairing this with the Inner Knowing Elixir and I find both highly liberating! D D.R. Incredible.....my favorite so far! INNER KNOWING is just beyond incredible. My very favorite so far....feels like a warm hug every single time. Thank you! G George F. Amazing for manifesting I gave this to a friend who credits it with helping her manifest a whole new life! She was able to tune in to her intuition in a very powerful way and seize opportunities as they presented.  It really helped her get unstuck and create the life she wanted. 1 2"

So glad I found it!! L L.M. Mindblowing! Is this for real?  How can this be?  A healthy brown liquid in a bottle that tastes like cola when dropped in to sparkling water? This is a miracle in a bottle.  A dream come true.  Cannot say enough about how impressed and grateful I am to find this little treasure! R R.L. Great product My daughter, who loves conventional soda more than anything, loves this product. I suspect that the reishi along with other supplements that she uses, kept her healthy and negative when  several housemates were I'll and tested positive. Thank you!

Vanilla Cream Is Sooooooo Good! I put a few drops into my bottle of Topo Chico Mineral Water and savor it to the very last drop. I don't drink soda (pop where I am from :)) anymore but as a child I absolutely LOVED Cream Soda and this brings me there, except there is nothing unhealthy about it! I have been checking for the orange cream to be in stock again because I think combining the two flavors of vanilla cream and orange, would be so yum. Like the orange creamsicles I used to get long ago. J Julie W. A nice treat... At first I misread and added 3 to 4 drops and wasn't very impressed, and quickly realized it was 3 to 4 dropperfuls! Much better 😂 I plan on trying the other flavors. Grateful for healthier alternatives! Phew! Happy to hear you upped the ante! ; ) Super yummy. Maggie on our team has been making popsicles for us with the Root Beer drops ... with coocnut cream. SO YUMMY! She's perfecting the recipe now ~ so keep an eye out for the blog post with it! The perfect summer treat! C Corley M. Best treat and huge hit with my kids Whenever I tell my kids to drink water, they look at me with puppy dog eyes and ask “Lotus Wei Vanilla Cream?” It is their absolute favorite.  I’m so happy it is such a hit with them.  I too love it, it may be my favourite.  It is a fun treat to have in the hot summer and at the end of the day.  And aside from the delicious taste, my body just loves it.  I feel super after drinking it.  Thank you for making such a great product.  It means so much to me to offer my kids fun treats that are nourishing and healthy and it is joyful to sip on it myself!"

Boy, I was not disappointed!  I am energetically sensitive so scent is very important to me.  Over the years, there have been only a few perfumes that I could tolerate and after performing a heavy metal detox over the past year, I have been searching for an organic perfume because even the ones I liked before the cleanse seemed harsh afterwards, or rather not in alignment with me and what I desired.  So, I have been using these as perfumes by putting a few drops on each wrist and sometimes on my neck.  I thought I might resist reapplying them due to time constraints, but I take one of the compact bottles with me and love layering the scent several times throughout the day.  The scents seem dynamic because I can smell different characteristics at different times.  They are each very unique and I find that I keep sniffing my wrists.  Even with the couple that I am not drawn to the most, I found that when I set the intention to be open to what they might provide and tried them a few times, there was something intriguing about them.  As for the healing impact, I understand energy (I am a certified intuitive energy healer), so I have no doubt that they are supportive to me because they are from flower essences.  I am taking them while also using Sacred Body internally so a direct correlation is challenging to pinpoint.  It has only been a couple of weeks, but I am loving how peaceful and joyful I feel!  Plus, experimenting is fun and I love the flower scents!  I have already ordered a couple of additional scents that aren't in this set because I like the idea so much, want to identify my favorites, and create variety in my life.  I am not sure that I have ever reviewed anything before, but I am loving Lotuswei!"

R Robyn R. My kitty became a little love bomb! I started giving this to my kitty cuz he is sometimes shy and fearful… not w me, but w others. When I first got him years ago as a kitten he needed a lot of trips to the vet… so I figured maybe some not ideal treatment in his babyhood before I adopted him. Anyway, I have already noticed him being more loving and affectionate toward me, which I wouldn’t have imagined was possible, lol… although one morning he seemed to have a bit of a rough irritable morning and was demanding lots of attention… I figured maybe a kitty sized healing crisis."

Feeling deeply supported So far I have used Joy Juice, Infinite Love and Radiant Energy and will buy them again, when I have finished the whole set. I enjoy using the mists as a quick pick me up during the day. A moment to consciously reconnect to my intention and being present. I have seen shifts in my energy and how I relate to the world in using the essence and mist. Especially Joy Juice and Radiant Energy have helped me shifting my outlook on life and raising my energy. With Infinite Love a lot of self-love and self-worth topics came up and over the course of the month slowly dispersed leaving me with a better and deeper relationship with and appreciation of myself."

Why on earth would you market it as safe? Kidney problems are a known problem for cats. Thanks for your feedback! There is very little alcohol in the elixirs and if you add it to water or food, it is extremely minimal. However, we understand the concern; therefore, on the next print run, we will delete the line from our label that says you can put it on your hand and they can lick it off. Cats are such wise animals anyway that they will refuse what they don't like and what does not suit them! Also members of our community (whom have cats) have mentioned how beneficial and helpful the elixirs have been. And not at all harmful. xoxo C C.T. Great for my pup *and* for me! I purchased this elixir for my 13 year old golden retriever with separation and thunderstorm anxieties. Whenever I’m about to leave or if there’s a storm, I put a few drops in my palm and he licks it off. My kids tell me he’s much more happy and chill when I’m not there (he used to sulk by the front door until I got back home, but no longer). Also storms don’t seem to faze him anymore. I wish I had this amazing blend much sooner! I even tried some myself, when I wasn’t able to fall asleep, and it helped me not only get to sleep, but sleep more deeply. A ANJIE C. perfect for my little chihuahua my little chihuahua loves this elixir, she's needed it since there has been a lot of changes in the home. would recommend! S Sheila B. Just recently started using the Inner Peace for pets for my two shih tzu dogs. I put seven to ten drops on their assorted nightly treats. They calmed right down and started to look for a comfy place to rest. Totally met my expectations. Will purchase this for my dogs again."

Spritzing this amazing blend has become my first step in intentionally letting go and being open to all the beauty to vibrate with. Grateful it’s been a powerful reset for you - thank you for sharing! L Lanly L. Best jasmine scent The scent transports me to Hawaii and its not overpowering because all of a sudden I cant handle artificial smells anymore...its absolutely magical. Of course the auric shielding is wonderful too. It just makes me feel good. I'll most likely buy this product for life. So happy you love it—thank you so much! D Deandra Clear Boundaries I’ve been using this flower medicine for a little less than 4 weeks to date. Since then, I’ve had a family member experience an emergency medical situation, a situation where I’d previously experienced burnout as a caregiver. In using this floral elixir alongside several other floral elixirs including luminous chi, I’ve been able to set clear, precise boundaries, release energetic leeches and clearly state what I am and am not able to assist with. Folks have stepped up and I’ve been doing my inner work, along with experiencing these medicines, to be able to be rejuvenated and not depleted in the face of these turbulent times. Truly my body, my energy, my aura and my personhood are all sacred. And in using this medicine consistently, I am reminded of that and supported on this journey. So powerful! Thank you so much for sharing!! M Morgan T. In disbelief Thank you. I am in awe of the power of this essence. I truly feel a sense of peace using this that I did not expect to feel so quickly. The power of flowers never ceases to amaze, thank you!! R Rebecca Sacred Body Mist Absolutely obsessed with this beautiful mist!! Smells amazing!! I can’t get enough So happy you're loving it—enjoy every spritz! S Susan G. Honoring my body I have used this mist before, and felt it was time to use it again as the new year is starting. I feel it helps support my body . I use it along with the sacred heart mist and together I feel they create a calming and also energizing feeling. The smell is healing and heavenly. Thank you for your beautiful and heartfelt words! P Penny J. I meant to buy the spray however … As the title suggests, I meant to purchase the Sacred Body Mist and made a mistake ordering it. Perhaps there are no mistakes because the drops are giving me another practice session on working with my boundaries and being clearer in my yes and my no.  I’ve used Lotus Wei products in the past and l love them.  This product is every bit a good and beautiful. Beautiful perspective—thank you for sharing! B Beverly B. Scared  Body I love love this spray. Yay! So glad to hear it!! A Ann B. Sacred and delicious Lotus Wei Sacred Body Facial Mist is one of the sweetest kindest things I do for myself. The scent is pure magic and the essences that drift over me are so fragrant and soothing. I love everything about the ritual of feeling the mist on my face and neck and shoulders.

Embracing the Bad Ass in all Her most needed forms. I can't truly say exactly what occurred with True Strength due to the fact of taking it with other essences.   I will say this, in the vein of the body never lies.  I love this essence, no idea if it's placebo (due to the name) yet it kept calling me and Im stronger in my own ground and authenticity.  Self governed, audacious.   Having been one deeply ingrained more than most in a spiritual teaching for many many  years from a young age,  I say the days of spiritual teachers are over and clearly shown their flaws (and continue to).  We are in the time of sage and sorcerer where no followers are required!  Each of us that ... and necessary that we embody that inner sage and sorcerer, our unique fingerprint of God,  for our planet to evolve. More adults, less children - lions versus sheep.  Strong inner strength, and self ownership outside of all appearances (never the truth)  judgement, and self compromise.    Ive always been drawn to bad ass women, you know those who keep it real,  The sacred is bad ass! Look around.  Love is wild and uncompromising, not what our culture has dumbed us down with.  This facilitated the alignment of both the bad ass and the Bodhivista!  I never had children,  very clear it was never my calling.  I have always said, I'm no Mother (well thats not true as we all are) yet I'm one hell of a Mother F....... (oops !). Gently fierce one could say.  It strengthening, balancing and 'sourcing' wherever it is needed in both body/psyche!  Love it. A April E. Inner Strength Magnified I've had a hard year, emotionally. I've used other essences in the past but it was time for strength. It has helped to keep me in a strong frame of mind. I am thankful for having found this. April, thank you! :) What a beautiful gift to give yourself: strength. You got this. xoxo A A.W. Sovereignty The masculinity within that I never knew existed. Life takes its punches at me, yet I only feel my power and strength. I am a warrior. The flower essence blend that's made the biggest impression on me. I now have the ability to feel emotion without letting it consume me (water works). Made me feel as strong as a redwood! Things that might have hurt my feelings or made me feel inadequate in the past, bounced off me. Sovereignty over my emotions. Also met some of the most amazing and genuine people while taking this!! ~Like I was amongst angels on Earth L L.W. Extremely helpful when going through hard times I was recently divorced  from and 18 year marriage and also going through some really difficult situations including a job loss and breast cancer scare.  True Strength really helped me feel like I had the strength to handle all of this on my own. p p.m. Inner Strength I have been using this for two months now and it has really gave me a sense of stability and inner strength, like a supportive guardian helping you! love this one! S S.A. Intensely Magnificent LIBERATION This elixir has worked me intensely and magnificently. I was feeling overwhelmed with balancing all of commitments and thought this would help. Wow. This opened me up to so much more than I was anticipating. During my use so far I have unearthed MASSIVE shame in my relationship to myself, others and money. It illuminated my own lack trust - within myself, men and Life itself. Rather - it allowed me to develop a deeper sense of trust. I was trusting before use, or so I thought. This elixir showed me how much deeper I could and still can go. I feel more trusting which is providing support. I am still experiencing time scarcity and overwhelm with my commitments but I am noticing significant shifts. True Strength. As the name claims. Exactly what I needed. I am still working with it and will be ordering another bottle once I finish. L Lisa M. Wonderful I'm going through some major life changes - moving to a brand new city, new job, new life and I thought True Strength would be the perfect support at a time where I'm needing extra stability. It's been so wonderful! I really feel like ""I got this."" Excited to keep working with this one! E Elena L. Beautiful integration process The true strength elixir has helped me experience what TRUE Strength really feels like in my body:  a quiet and solemn determination, conviction and trust in my own presence and agency. There is nothing aggressive or imposing about it. It's like a river that runs deep within and is always accessible if I give myself time and feel the trust in my own abilities. This elixir was a wonderful continuation and integration of working with the RedWood  Tree  earlier this year. While taking it I often  have dreams where I am in a deeply trusting and loving situation with a male counterpart. It is not sexual but truly intimate. I always woke up with a deep sense of peace, safety and profound content: the male figures in my dreams are reflections of my own inner masculine showing up and being  integrated and embraced by my other aspects. Something I have always struggled with: my feminine and masculine parts weren't even talking to each other a few years ago. For the first time ever I feel like I belong to myself and need nothing from the outside, at the same time I feel more at ease with the people around me and effortlessly establishing and maintaining my boundaries. S Susan True Strength True Strength elixir has been liberating for me. The first day I felt nothing. The second day I was feeling stronger and more integrated. Then my exercise routine was more joyful! I began getting out in to nature more and became more adventuresome. I don't feel as fearful about life events because I know that deep within me I have this core of true strength and inner wisdom that leads me in the right direction. 1 2"

This is the essence that won me over to the power and efficacy of Lotuswei essences!  I have used it in all its forms.  My favorite is the mist.  It only takes a squirt or two for me to feel this grounding forcefield of strength.  I imagine the redwood tree immersing my body, making me feel grounded, connected, and safe.  I had been taking it a while before I noticed that.  I love the earthy aroma!  I have been working with this essence for a couple of years now.  Every time I think of stopping taking it, I realize I still want more!  I have had delightful experiences in my personal life with all the plants in the essence.  I am getting better about not expecting the worst-case scenarios to play out in life, but I still have growth in that area.  I guess I had the rug pulled out from under me enough times in my early life, that it set up a pattern of fear that has been hard to shake.  So thrilled to have my companion essence with me now. We’re so grateful this essence has supported you so beautifully! D Denise D. True Strength Mist Felt supported, more empowered. Love the scent! Highly recommend! Yay!! So glad to hear you're loving it! B B.N. Love this mist Thank you for your feedback :) We are glad you love it! J Joel P. True strength not a winner I am sorry to say that the true strength must I received is has not been a pleasant experience for me or my friends.  The scent is unpleasant and has illicited some scowls and repulsion by those I have shared it with.  It has a slightly mildewed hang in the air. Thank you for sharing your feedback about the True Strength Mist. We are sorry to hear you did not enjoy the scent - it is VERY distinctive. We understand that scent is very much about individual taste. The True Strength scent profile illicits the smell of a camp fire and has a smokiness to it due to the combined essential oils of Hinoki, Benzoin, Cedar, Cardamom + Tobacco :) We recommend you try the honey elixir instead if the scent is just not to your liking :) https://www.lotuswei.com/collections/true-strength The elixirs are ingestible and so do not contain essential oils or a scent! xoxo C Caroline It’s magic in a bottle.  The smell and everything about it including the energy is just awesome. J J.J. Very very effective. Didn’t know flower essences were so powerful. It’s like magic. J J.C. Absolutely stunned (in the best way!) I took this flower quiz right after my husband and I separated. My life was so uncertain, I was having trouble sleeping, worried about how/if I was going to be able to financially support myself and my kids, feeling so alone and stressed - much of which was tied to another heartbreaking situation 14 years ago. When my results came back and I read what True Strength was all about, I just bawled. I ordered it right away. Within 4 days I could tell a difference. 2 weeks later and I am now so calm, self-assured, feel very supported, and am having no problem focusing on self-compassion first. My mind can't fully grasp HOW these work, but it doesn't matter - because they do and that's all I care about. S S.G. POWERFUL SUPPORT True Strength is my favorite mist of LotusWei. I have been in a very deep transition for the past couple of years, but especially the last few months. I was acutely aware of the depth I was in and getting ready to birth new work, a new body and a new phase of my life, but unable to do anything to assist any movement except rest, sleep a lot, and isolate.  These states have not been natural to me in this life, but True Strength really held me through it with a sense of trust and knowing that this was exactly what was required for my health, well being on all levels, and had to happen before there could be any movement forward. It has been more healing than I could have imagined. I am so grateful for the support of this blend. and now as I move out more, I am switching to Inspired Action and Luminous Embodiment (my other favorite!). Also, I was not drawn to the mists originally, but doing a body change program where honey was not allowed, I switched and now am fully into the mist magic! G G.R. Transformative 4 weeks into using the True Strength mist I started to notice the difference. My feelings of loneliness that came with lost connections dissipated and I felt more hopeful, stable and balanced. It felt as though my eyes were opened to the wider possibilities of life. I have also been dealing with overexertion much better. In my opinion, this is a must have in anyone's self-care tool kit. It is the driving force to get things done while remaining optimistic and grounded."

Intoxicating After using this oil for a few times, it has quickly become one of my favorites - it has a unique earthy and spicy scent that draws me in for more. I have felt it very supportive in my journey of self awareness. It has a subtle way of reminding me to draw my focus in and lead from my heart. So grateful you shared your experience here Lauren! Yes! True Strength has such a unique scent to it ~ draws me in too ;) xoxo K K.M. Supportive Reminder of Inner Strength I love using the anointing oil as a reminder of my own internal strength. In moments when I am feeling fragile, exhausted, doubtful, insecure... I put the oil on my wrists, inhale its sweet and spicy scent, and tune into my own strength. These small reminder moments are so supportive to the unfolding of my day. K K.A. Divine Masculine This is one of my favorite anointing oils...the scent is SO amazing! It brought back the memory of loving sitting in the bathroom with my grandfather while he shaved when I was little. When I first started taking it I had a mild healing crisis/breakdown. I realized my true feelings about my parent's divorce when I was 3, and that all of this time I thought it's not a big deal, but I finally admitted that I am heartbroken of all the years of time I didn't get to spend with my dad, that it does hurt and that I have lacked a healthy relationship with men  because of it. I feel like I have tried replacing the father relationship in my romantic relationships. After this realization I went and spent some time with my dad, and we both agreed it was one of the best times we've ever had together! I felt able to open up and be much closer. I also feel more at peace with myself, like I dont need to seek anything outside of myself, that I have my own inner masculine to support me and I feel much stronger and more upright in my posture and ability to assert myself. Thank you for this gift! E E.H. new favorite My new favorite anointing oil... definitely a scent of true strength. It brings me to the cabin in the woods... one of my favorite places to come back to center and source. C C.M. Amazing Scent The scent of this oil is indescribable, unlike anything I have ever encountered.  It is intoxicating.  I love it and all of my kids love it as well. The energetic effect of this anointing oil is truly potent.  I feel steady, grounded, strong and anchored.  My capacity and my energetic vantage point in approaching, navigating remarkably challenging circumstances is remarkably different.  I feel strong and capable of navigating anything. The write up suggests it supports healing ancestral traumas and wounds and I can attest to the positive impact it had in this area of my healing.  The deep insights that arose while using this and their deeply rooted ancestral connection was profound.  Thank you.  Remarkable. A A.C. A doubter no more! I was very leery of these products as it definitely sounded too woowoo to me. I’ve only had the True Strength anointing oil for less than a week and have noticed great results!

Post Partum Inner Strength This serum/spray was gifted to me during my babies sleep regression and helped a great deal finding my balance and being with what is while staying awake at all hours. Thank you for taking the time to leave this feedback for our True Strength Serum. We are so glad to hear that it was able to help you during such a challenging time. We understand the difficulties of postpartum and are happy that flower essences helped to provide you with some inner strength and balance. :) xoxo B Beth U. Strong Tall Rooted I am particularly drawn to True Strength in the Serum. I love applying it to my feet and legs at bedtime to help me wake up confident and rooted in my self. The first evening applying it, I had the words/image pop into my mind - “tall spine” and I sat up straighter. The aromatherapy is gorgeous, coniferous and sweet and subtler in the serum for bedtime than the oil. I’ve been noticing I have more courage to (try to) set better boundaries with other people which is difficult and ongoing for me. 🌲 💕 C Christine S. I have alway's been terrible with my boundaries but this last year I have started to really work on them and to rebuild my nervous system, which is rather frayed from years of over pleasing at the detriment of my wellbeing . I most certainly feel stronger physically and emotionally , the smell is very masculine which is unusual for me as I prefer many of the others but I was at a party and everybody said I smelt lovely "" please tell me what that is "" So I've just ordered the anointing oil , Lotus Wei is my go to everyday , I sometimes mix them up depending  what I need  , but I always feel so much better . Thank goodness we can buy them for the UK my heart would be broken without them , thank you so much for these precious tools xxxxxxx"

P.S. my doggie LOVES the elixir too ZEN puppy! E Emily M. Unstoppable Luminous Chi may be my favorite yet. I have been dealing with so much stress and stagnation in my life. I feel unstoppable now. There is confidence and self-assurance that I haven't felt in quite a while. I feel like I am waking up and stepping forward and accomplishing what I am here to do. There is ease to my day now because I am not wallowing in self-doubt. A Ashley R. Fire-Breathing Dragon Luminous Chi makes me feel pulsing with hot life-force energy! As someone who tends more towards cold/yin I could feel the effects of this elixir right away. I feel overall more solid and warm in my body, especially in my spine & lower back. I had a flare of anger over something in a situation where I normally “let it go” where afterwards I was afraid I may have burned a bridge–but instead the other person respected me more and now I have a firm boundary in the place where I used to have a massive energy drain. This plus Radiant Energy are my new standby flower remedies. M M.B. Moving forward!!! Luminous Chi anointing oil smells divine and exotic. The spray is more subtle but still lovely. Taking the elixir has given clarity to so many issues previously holding me back.  Thank you Katie and team xoxo M Maya H. Personal Evolution in a bottle Pre-ordered this kit, and was super excited to receive it. It did NOT disappoint. The fragrance is musky and complex (think Thai food, with lots of lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves). The effects are far reaching. Have reached major milestones in relationships, to self and others. Will be reordering this one again."

So, I’ve been a longtime user of LOTUSWEI and I usually feel things intensely right away or at least I’m immediately tuned into it. And if not immediately, it comes and I feel it coming. With this one, I’ve held off reviewing because I just don’t know. I’m not getting anything. I’m not feeling anything. There been no difference. I’ve been using it over a month. The scent isn’t effective either. I’ve never encountered this. It has me puzzled. Thank you so much for your thoughtful feedback — we really appreciate you taking the time to share, especially as someone who's so in tune. It actually sounds like this particular blend may not be something your body needs to work with right now — and that’s a beautiful reflection of how connected you are to yourself. One of the best ways to choose a flower essence is by letting your body guide you — which is exactly why we love the Flower Quiz. It bypasses the mind and helps identify what your system is really craving on a deeper level. We’d love to support you in finding something that feels more aligned. If you’re open to it, we can recommend a new blend based on your quiz results or chat more about what you're working through right now. N Namrata Simply amazing Loved the essence So glad you are enjoing it, thank you! A Anna I use this daily and wouldn’t be without it! G George D. Gave it to a friend and she said the last week since she got it has been the best in her life A Anonymous Love this stuff Incredible tool for up-leveling your life!! And it smells so good! G G.A. Beautiful Scent and Experience I have really loved my Luminous Chi spray, and have felt a shift since I started using it. The scent is wonderful and I spray it constantly through out the day, because it is so wonderful. I would definitely buy this product again, it is one of my new favorites. D D.B. Such a blessing, highly recommended! I was super excited about this because it's exactly what I needed, I was counting down the days when Lotus wei first announced it haha.... And it does not dissppoint, I'm legit stunned about its magic! It instantly feels like this warm embrace that makes you relax more.... I found myself spontenously setting boundaries on things I previously avoided addressing... I'm more comfortable taking a stance and staying centred and compassionate in doing so... increases my capacity to deal with things in general I think.... I'm still using it every day, but that's some results I felt so far and I'm super happy about it. :) M M.W. Smells tropical! The aroma of this is like stepping off a plane and into Hawaii, it has the floral and earthy smell that hits you when you land on the islands, like many, many fresh flower leis mixed with the tropical earth meets ocean smell. I keep going back for more, it’s intoxicating :)"

Perfect during a rough time My workplace went from being a safe haven to somewhere I needed to leave. Using this remedy enabled me to give notice and exit with personal and professional integrity and although wounded, my sanity. I am so grateful. J J.M. I can’t believe it! I absolutely love the luminous chi set. Tbh it really does work, if not even for the fact that it reminds me to stop and remember why I need it, it just brings awareness to my needing to be mindful. I’ve been using it for about a week now and I’m already have a strong want to be happy and maintain that joy. So happy! S S.M. Just what I needed I've been taking this for a few weeks and I've just been so enthralled with the beauty of everyday life. Which is NOT how I've been feeling for a while now. This blend is just what I needed. I just did the meditation and tears streamed down my face. I've been feeling so unsupported in my life, and hearing Katie say the world around me is loving and supporting me, words cannot express the relief and gratitude. She repeated ""I love you and have your back at the end"", and I felt like she was talking specifically to me. Incredible blend as always, thank you all for bringing this magic to the world. R Ruth L. Perfect timing It's really helping me be ME, feeling stronger and supported in the season I'm currently in my growth and shifts I'm experiencing!  Amazing! A A.L. Lightening Since adding this to my daily practice I have found that maintaining my inner glow has come with greater ease R Robyn R. Love this elixir This elixir is a combines four flower elixirs that I have previously used as single elixirs! Since I have been using it some old trauma has arisen to the surface for release, which is challenging but very positive for healing and wholeness. I do also notice dissolving of feelings that people and life are dangerous and unsafe and feelings of needing to hide. Also notice awareness of boundaries and privacy rights and needs. This is one that I plan to use month after month. I have been using it in combination with infinite love elixir which is another that I find I go back to repeatedly."

It’s become my “you can do this” ritual Subtle yet doing it’s job, both the spray mist and elixir drops have been boosting my confidence and giving me that pat on the back, like that, “you can do this” or “I believe in you” nudge when you may be feeling otherwise. I love the scent, jasmine is my all time favorite—Thank you!! Thank you for trusting us with your confidence ritual! J Jennifer A. Beautiful heart healing Hi , Im currently using the sacred heart flower essence and the sacred heart mist .

MUCH gratitude 🪽. Jen Augustine Wow! It's wonderul to hear the Sacred heart is nourishing your heart—what a beautiful journey. C Christopher Smells amazing- received promptly 🙏 M Margaret K. Perfect gift I gifted Sacred Heart to my very busy, service-oriented mother and I've never been so excited to give someone something! She loves it & I know it's so good for her. Thank you, Lotus Wei 🩷 So happy Sacred Heart is supporting her! T Trena This is so beautiful, when I spray it it makes me feel part of the Universe. T T.C. So powerful I've used this blend in moments of felt crisis and it immediately puts me into a state of ease, which is just mind blowing in how quickly I can do a 180. Just one drop of anointing oil and I immediately notice the energy around me turning more clear, crisp, and bright. I also caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror after using the oil and was shocked at how my eyes are so clear as well - like something actually got flushed out big time! I love all of the LotusWei blends but in this moment I think this one's my new best friend. Thank you so much Katie and LotusWei team for the magic you put out into the world <3 Wow, love that about your eyes! We notice that in people when they come into our Flagship store in Phoenix & get showered with flower essences. But it's even more WHOA when you see it in yourself. Stunning! A A.M. Gentle yet powerful medicine. A few years ago I tried working with flower essences from different brand without any notable impact—perhaps it was the maker, the wrong remedy, or I simply wasn't ready for their teachings. I thought maybe flower essences were too subtle for me, or just kind of a joke. I was called to Sacred Heart as its description perfectly matched recent events and challenges in my life, and I was curious enough to give the flowers another chance. This formula blew me away. The mist enveloped me in a gorgeous aroma that didn't irritate or overpower, and brought my intention to my own field and the heart work that I was performing within it. By the second day of use, I was given the beautiful gift of a pearlescent shield that protects me to this day, and was able to connect with the Mother Consciousness. Sacred Heart walked with me for about a Moon cycle and contributed to my resiliency, openness, and softness as I birthed a new version of myself into reality. Wonderful! :) C Caroline S. Much needed I didn’t realise how much I needed this til I started misting myself.  Love the aroma too! Thank you Love to hear you're enjoying it! Thanks for sharing :) A A.M. Profound My first purchase of many. I ordered Sacred Heart at a very low point in my life and it helped me heal and become more resilient in those moments of pain. SO wonderful to hear! Thank you for sharing!! J J.H. softening into a deeper truth I was afraid to take this essence and enter into what felt like dark caves of the heart, spaces of grief I felt unprepared to confront. It didn't feel safe to soften--I wanted to stay a bit armored in my life to make it through a challenging chapter. But something nudged me to take this remedy anyway. I experienced a profound softening: my ""threat detection system"" had apparently been in overdrive, and I no longer contracted in the face of false threats. I felt safer and more expressed in conflict. Dreams revealed to me the fear I had experienced was a false overlay, a narrative I could separate from my experience. This remedy very much exemplified the Jungian adage that the cave we fear to enter holds the treasures we seek: the cave was my own heart, and I found safety where I had once been too afraid to look, much less feel. I just ordered two more bottles so I have time to sit with the unfolding of a softness I have longed for and not known was possible. Amazing! Thank you for leaving your feedback :) 1 2 3"

Powerful Insight I have been using the Luminous Chi oil daily for the past two weeks to ""prepare"" and ""protect"" my nervous system for each day. There has been a noticeable strength and groundedness unfolding while my need to protect myself decreased. During a recent incident where I was triggered, I clearly spoke my truth and maintained a balanced conversation yet felt energetically ""gut punched"" and guilty afterwards. I checked myself and noticed that the emotions did not belong to me but to the other party. Great time to test this oil some more! I applied a few drops to my wrist and let it do its magic...within seconds I could holographically see my energy field and how the gut punch and guilt energies and feelings were removed from my field immediately while establishing a firm layer of authentic boundary (like a dent being removed). I felt whole, relaxed and protected while being able to maintain my boundaries in an open and approachable way. This is such an easy and pleasant tool to help myself without suppressing or avoiding old patterns! Beautiful! So glad to hear it is providing you support! P P.C So Grateful !! I did not think the Joy juice Elixir would work so quickly as I am aware that it is all to do with how well your body absorbs, therefore I was pleasantly surprised to feel I had calmed down quite quickly, and I was not serious anymore as I normally am all day long, when trying to get all work done as well as keeping the family on track. I just felt the joy juice working within the first dosage I took and it got better with subsequent dosages. Thank you so much to you and your team for this wonderful product and working so hard for sharing it with the world. So grateful to have you be apart of the flower family & thank you for sharing!! S Stephanie M. Powerful The effects of this anointing oil were rapid. Big shifts took place right away. The shifts were not easy, but at the same time were exactly what I was needing. It definitely gave me strength to maneuver through. I was/am shifting old, outdated systems and structures in my life (they are everywhere!). When using this one, I’d say buckle in. It means business! Grateful for you sharing your experience! J Joyce W. Ahhhh! So uplifting I use Luminous Chi serum as well as Luminous Chi Mist several times a day. It immediately lifts my spirits to new heights.  Delicious, energizing, simply divine! Thank you for your wonderful review! We're thrilled to hear that our Luminous Chi Anointing Oil has been able to uplift your spirits and energize you throughout the day. We hope it continues to bring you joy and positivity. xoxo M Michele I can feel it moving through my body already! I just started using this today and I could immediately feel it moving through my body. My mood changed almost right away and the scent is absolutely divine. Thank you for making such a beautiful product in which I can feel all of the love and intention that was placed into making it. Flower power all the way! Thank you so much for your glowing testimonial! We're thrilled to hear that you can already feel the effects of our Luminous Chi Anointing Oil. Our team puts a lot of love and intention into creating each product, so we're glad it's making a positive impact on your mood. We appreciate your support and hope you continue to experience the power of flowers :) M M.M. Very helpful This came into my life at the right time. I kept getting this blend during my flower quiz over several months, while it was still in production - I was thrilled to finally get it. I didn't notice the effects at first, but after using it for a bit I can tell you that it truly has helped me. This is my go-to when I know that I need to have a difficult conversation at work, or be on a call with a coworker or person that can ruffle my feathers. When I previously have felt defensive, or like I've run out of patience, this has definitely helped cool my head, be more of a team player, and less agitated with certain people. I will continue to keep this on hand. A A. Delicious scent What an intriguing scent...and when on my skin, combines with my chemistry deliciously. I have received many compliments. The power of this flower essence is immense. It isn't instantaneous. It isn't due to positive thinking. It created in me a shift from feeling attacked and judged to sudden and complete ease and joy. It was like the brilliant heat of noonday sun after an eclipse. K K.A. Incredible scent I just received Luminous Chi anointing oil and I am so struck by its unique exotic scent. It really does smell like a Thai herbal compress during a Thai massage, with some other intriguing notes as well. I am excited to see how using it goes over time! I also got Sacred Body mist and I love the 2 scents together, reminds me of being in Thailand and brings back the joy of my times there! I am a big fan of desert milkweed and have that as a single essence, so I find it interesting that I chose 2 blends that include it...thank you Lotuswei love this unique and intoxicating blend :)"

I feel a gentle, tender, sacred feeling when I mist this overhead!  I gifted this to my mother for Christmas, and she loves it too!  This is a fabulous essence for self-nurturing. Thank you for your kind words! So happy you both love it! A Anonymous lightly fragrant and calming this very much matches my needs at this moment...a light appealing fragrance that has some calming and centering appeal So glad it’s the perfect match for you! D Divinely A. Amazing Tool for Self Love enhancement I was recently introduced to your products through a amazing woman I know. We had been having so many conversations about developing our selves beyond our current experiences. This technology is beyond any ethereal enhancement I have used in recent years . It has been refreshing to feel grateful for myself at a much deeper level. Thank you so much for sharing! Wishing you continued enrichment and expansion—you deserve it!

Thank you So glad to hear that you're experiencing such a positive shift! Thank you for sharing!! T T.C. Comfort in a bottle There's something so deeply comforting to me about this mist - it feels like I've been wrapped in layers of soft blankets and the scent is just to die for. Even though the mists aren't seasonal, I found myself craving this scent as soon as things started slipping into fall (Fierce Compassion feels that way to me too, like the perfect fall companion) and I keep coming back to it. It really makes me feel so soft and feminine - I just love it so much. Thank you Theresa for your beautiful share! xo J J.Q. So profound and supportive I’ve been using the anointing oil for over six months and it has helped me heal tremendously! I find that it’s much easier to nourish myself when I use it, and I’ve never felt more fulfilled being single. I’ve been using it in conjunction with other consistent healing practices. It’s made such a huge difference. I think this is my favorite Lotuswei product of all time! It smells so good and feels I’m being embraced by the divine.

Game Changer - Deep Healing Sacred Awareness has been the boost my energy needed. I started adding drops to my water, and I could feel the support. The awareness I experienced within myself and the world around me - people, places and in my business- has clarified my desires.  I take Sacred Awareness, Expanded Presence, and DIvine Within together as I work on expanding my practice and identifying how to attach my will to the projects that support my desires. Thank you! Grateful Sacred Awareness brings you clarity and support. J Joy does what it says it will I definitely notice an increase in my intuition on days that I add the drops to my morning drink.  What a helpful elixir! Thank you for sharing your beautiful experience with us! A Alyssa This is one of my favorite products from Lotus Wei although I love the 4 I’ve tried. Well worth it! J Jennifer I love love my flower essence! It’s makes everything better, more self aware. Easier to handle the hard stuff S Siri B. Instantly fell in love This smell is everything. It’s divine. I instantly fell in love and can’t get enough of it. Since starting to use these flower essences (this one and Game Changer) I have felt revived. My energy and motivation is back. I get shit done. I have started exercising and lost 1kg a week. I don’t know what it is but it works, trust me! Thank you Siri :) So happy for you! R R.K. My favorite product of all! Instant mood boost. P Pam G. Powerful flower essence It has helped me connect with a coworker with actively listening, making eye contact, connecting with my intuition with deep vulverabilty to support a person going through a rough time. I love the way this smells, fudgey cardamom dusted brownies. Connecting with clients through interesting conversations. Thank you so much for sharing your experience of Sacred Awareness! We are so glad to hear that it has helped you connect more with your coworker and support them during a difficult time. We appreciate your kind words about the scent, and we hope that the interesting conversations with your clients continue. Wishing you the best on your continued journey with Sacred Awareness :) xoxo C C.P. Very powerful blend/my new favorite I have been using the Sacred Awareness elixir together with the mist which I bought first, and then I had to have the elixir.  It helps me to feel grounded while staying open to a calm flow of awareness.  I feel that it is very much a present moment experience.  The stream orchid feels gently grounding to me.  I love the coral root orchid for its expansiveness.  The Venus fly trap threw me off at first, because I could not integrate the thought of eating flies. Lol!  So I worked with my judgment around this plant and now I feel that is a very lovely plant and one that is very necessary.  I credit the Venus flytrap plant for helping me to rescue my neighbors cat who had darted out her front door.  Being in the right place at the right time I would say.  When I first started taking this elixir, I noticed the fringed orchid, bee orchid and blue penstemon working together to help me express myself in a way that they didn’t make me feel self-conscious. It definitely helps to connect with the energy of the room, which is something that does not come naturally to me, so I know it was the flower essence!  The Taiwanese Azalea has inspired me to buy more fresh flowers! Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with Sacred Awareness. We are thrilled to hear that it has become your new favorite and that it has helped you feel grounded and open to awareness. We appreciate your recognition of the stream orchid, coral root orchid, and Venus fly trap in the blend, and are glad they have been beneficial for you. We are so happy to hear that it has helped you connect with the energy of the room and express yourself more confidently! We hope you continue to enjoy the Taiwanese Azalea and other fresh flowers! How beautiful. Thank you for choosing us, and for being a part of our community :) xoxo xoxo K Kathleen C. Growth, shifting awareness Three weeks after beginning sacred awareness it became obvious i was experiencing big growth. Areas of my life where I always experience analysis paralysis, I was able to quickly determine what needed to be done, and more forward. I'm also able to complete tasks easier, in many areas.  I'm feeling that I'm getting out of my way. Huge challenges have come up in my personal life. I've been able to handle them smoother. Allowing myself to feel the feelings, and move through.  I'm showing grace and patience, by accepting others for who they are. I purchased 2 more bottles to keep unwinding long held ways of being that just don't serve me.  It's astonishing to realize how many shifts I've experienced. Thank you Katie! S Sherrill P. Love This Product I bought Sacred Awareness on a recommendation from the Holistic Spaces podcast episode 257. Katie Hess was the guest speaker and she shared a forecast about the new year and recommendations on personalized flower elixirs to support each of the Chinese zodiac animals.  I am a Dragon so, Sacred Awareness was the recommendation. I mist the top of my head and my heart just before I go into a meeting with my clients. I feel calm and with being calm I feel I can give my clients the needed attention and be an active listener in order to give understanding and encouragement  to each of them.  I am excited to try more of Lotuswei's flower elixirs. Hey Sherrill! A million thanks for writing in to us about your experience of Sacred Awareness! I want to leave these bonus treasures with you to go alongside your experience of SA: https://www.lotuswei.com/pages/sacred-awareness-treasures xoxo 1 2 3"

Feeling great I’ve easily incorporated this set of flower essences into my daily life.  I see and feel the difference!  And the people around do as well.  A friend told me “You seem more light and at ease lately, and at the same time very engaged and sharp!”"

Perfect combination of annointing oils! I purchased the love everywhere kit and having all of these together has been helping through a most challenging and difficult trauma event of my life. All beautiful scents, synergistic with each other if used in combination, and wonderful alone. Infinite love and fierce compassion are two I have already used extensively for a long time, having sacred heart and divine within and open heart additionally… beautiful. I recoomend this for opening and softening to both grief and pain, and love and happiness. Thank you Robyn for sharing your powerful experience - we hope you continue to feel the extra support from flowers within this kit :) I wanted to also let you know that pairing these powerful anointing oils with journaling and meditation amplfies their support even further - we have a compilation of bonus treasures featuring journal prompts etc which I'll link below!

Making dreams happen I’ve taken Divine Timing before in both the mist and elixir, during the beginning of the year as well as around my birthday. I find it really helps me to reflect on the year and set intentions for what’s next. Most recently I’ve used the mist for the past 6 months consistently and feel it helped me complete a creative project and dream of mine that I’ve had for my entire life!  I especially connected to the Angelica flower and sense of unseen support and synchronicity.  Thank you for this beautiful product!  On the cusp of my birthday I am taking it again as I set  new dreams in motion for the year ahead. Wow—so incredible to hear and honored it could support your journey! A Ana O. Not sure Hmm not really feeling this. I’m very sensitive to energies and get a lot of vibrations from other therapies I’ve tried but this one just doesn’t seem to land. It feels like it sets my allergies off (am I imagining this as not sure pollen is in there) and haven’t noticed any benefits at all really. I have had some amazing leaps in consciousness from meditation etc but this just doesn’t seem to be moving anything forward or improving my life. Sorry! Flowers just obviously aren’t my vibe! I get the energy shifting shudders when I look at a beautiful flower but the scent just doesn’t seem to affect me.  Shame as I was open minded and really excited to try. Thank you so much for your honest feedback — we really appreciate you giving it a try, even if it didn’t land the way you’d hoped. Are you finding the scent itself isn't sitting well? We add a light blend of essential oils in our mists to pair with the flower essences for a sensorial experience, but the real power comes from the flower energy, rather than the smell. If the scent itself isn't sitting well, you may be drawn more to the elixir, which doesn't have a scent & is taken internally! May we ask also how frequently you've been using the mist? We find that consistency is key: using it 5–8 times a day for at least 21 days helps your system sync with the essences & allows shifts to unfold more deeply. All that said, we totally understand that not every modality resonates with everyone. We’re grateful you are open to exploring it, and we’re always here if you'd like support finding something that might be a better fit! A Alicia M. Surrendering to the mystery I am using this blend as I have just started a new chapter in my life. There are synchronicities everywhere, reminders and affirmations from the universe that I am right where I am supposed to be. This blend, for me, gives the feeling of “surrendering to the mystery.” I feel like each new day plays out in a serendipitous way, and I am comfortable trusting in the divine timing of things. So honored to support you in life’s beautiful unfolding. S Stefani B. WOW Mindblown at how fast this works to deepen connection with the unseen and TRUST the flow of Alignment and Receiving with a sense of softness, security, and stability. So glad to hear it’s landing deeply and working fast! B Barbara P. Opening new possibilities I’d like to say it’s the only thing I’ve been doing and it has made all the difference, but that would not be true. However, I would say that it has definitely contributed to a huge shift in my life from non-productivity and anxiousness about the lack of productivity to being relaxed with how and when things are showing up. Much to my surprise and intense pleasure the more I relax and allow, the more shows up! I am grateful for the Divine Timing giving me that ease. 'The more I relax and allow, the more shows up.' Love this. Non-attachment = freedom. z zelda Yummy anointing oil! This is my favorite anointing oil that I have tried!  It smells so fabulous!  I just ordered my second bottle and can't wait.  I noticed divine protection/ support when taking this essence.  A beautiful gentle feeling.  That is what I remember most. Thank you for sharing! So happy you feel supported! K Kate K. Synchronicities abound! It’s only been a couple of weeks using Divine Timing, but I’ve been blown away from the synchronicities showing up in my life. And maybe they’ve always been there, but Divine Timing is bringing the signs and connections more into my awareness. I’ve been struggling to figure out what’s next for me in my career and not only have the answers been showing up in huge ways, but I’ve been able to balance both excitement and faith in the timing of it all working out for my highest good. I’m so very grateful to have found Lotus Wei and have noticed subtle changes in my life over the last year and a half of using different products. The anointing oils, elixirs, serums, and sprays are truly a delight to use through out my day. I feel deeply connected to and supported by these flower essences, more so than any supplement or herb that I’ve ever used. So much gratitude! Grateful you’re experiencing these synchronicities. Thank you for sharing! S Sharon H. Works like magic! I absolutely love this essence mix. It’s helped me get motivated on a creative project I was feeling stuck about. I’ve been receiving a lot of downloads and am just going with the flow of divine timing! So glad it's sparking creativity and flow—wishing you endless inspiration! J Julie More at ease with divine timing & not my own timing This is my first foray with flower essences and I took the quiz for myself, then my mother and sister did as well. We were all in survival mode dealing with my Mom’s memory loss. We each started our own combination of essences that we were drawn to. Divine Timing was one of mine. I felt things working in my favor shortly thereafter and feeling a sense of ease with the timing of things, not so attached to when things need to happen and more willing to leave it to the Divine. The customer support was super  helpful recommending some of the ones that could work for my Mother too. We did a combo from the quiz and some that were recommended. Thank you so much! Really loving using the flower essences! Embracing divine timing is so powerful—thank you! P Patricia L. Divine retreat I took my anointing oil of Divine Timing to my yoga retreat in Mexico, and while I think any blend would do wonders while on retreat in mexico.. I am grateful for the gentle yet sagely nudges this blend did for me. I feel very anchored to a greater trust and worthiness of myself. I released a lot of doubt. My confidence spoke up. I feel connected to the wisdom within and have more patience to honor the current and next best steps. Thank you ❤️ Beautiful! Grateful Divine Timing supported your journey so deeply! ❤️ And thank you for sharing this photo—so incredible! 1 2 3"

Heightened Intuition I got this along with Quiet Mind elixir and Inner Knowing spray. WOW my intuition is off the charts. Synchronicities are popping up like wild flowers. And my awareness of them is also heightened. I chose these three items because I took the quiz. I was drawn to the flowers in these blends. I really appreciate the scent of Divine Truth. It's not overpowering, not too floral - a little woody and while I am not typically drawn to such profiles, this is a good one! Would recommend and buy again. Oh, and when it says ""Be fearlessly authentic and transparent"" that is no joke. I found myself really speaking up in a video meeting today. I was getting ""downloads"" during the whole call and I just shared them, like a full on sage. Didn't feel bad about it at all, like I used to do. Wow — love that you're feeling so aligned! z zelda Revealing This definitely had an effect on me!  I was taking it when visiting with family, and had an intense expression about a former grievance, that I wasn't planning to ever talk about. We haven't finished talking about it, but it did bring some clarity.  I would love to take more of this essence...... but there are SO many fabulous essences to choose from, I can't take them all! So glad it brought clarity! So many wonderful essences! k katie h. Very grounding Helps me get back in my body instantly! That's wonderful to hear it helps you feel grounded and present! A Andrew A. THEE Divine Moment of Truth This essence came into my life at the exact right time(along with Divine Timing). I am currently in a profound waking experience with the (w)holy trinity: mind, body, and spirit. Everything is lining up and old “truths” are being shattered left and right. I’m currently leaving a well paying job to transition into a career of service to humanity with no cares of the financial outcomes because I truly feel that humanity needs a re-alignment on every front. Thank you LotusWei 🪷 for contributing to my ascension . I will make you proud(and tell my friends about your products) Thank you so much for taking the time to leave such beautiful feedback. We are so happy to hear that Divine Truth has had a positive impact on your life during this important time of awakening! We are honored to be a part of your journey, & we have no doubt that you will make a positive impact on humanity through your service. Thank you for spreading the word about us and we look forward to seeing all the amazing things you will accomplish. Keep shining bright! xoxo E Eugene S. Flower power. I met Lisa and Katie at an event in Texas and gravitated to Divine Truth in their tent. I have noticed a difference in my confidence in expressing my true potential in the following weeks. Misting the essences liberally daily is transformational in the way i carry myself and make decisions. Thank you Lotus Wei for making this powerful flower alchemy available to the public. Thank you so much for taking the time to leave a review for Divine Truth! We are thrilled to hear that our flower alchemy has had such a positive impact on your confidence and self-expression. We are grateful to have been able to share our flower essences with you, and we hope they continue to bring transformation to your daily life. Thank you for choosing Lotuswei :) xoxo J J.H. Gentle, softening, opening I have felt really good on this blend--it helped me get to the root of my lifelong anxiety, which stems, as it turns out, from not acting/speaking from my heart. This remedy has gently directed my awareness to the places where I am not being fully honest and present with myself and in my life. Taking a few breaths and feeling into those spaces and then acting from my truth and POOF, anxiety dissolves. I am so pleasantly surprised by this blend, and I am so thankful it comes in a larger bottle so I can spend more time exploring the consciousness it brings. Thank you for your thoughtful feedback of 'Divine Truth'. We are so glad to hear that it has had a positive impact on your well-being and helped you to address your anxiety. It truly warms our hearts to know that our blend has been able to guide you towards being more honest and present with yourself. We hope that it continues to bring you clarity and peace in your journey towards living your truth. Thank you for choosing our product and sharing your experience with us. Wishing you all the best. L L.D. Opening Divine Truth is my first elixir and mist duo. I have noticed increased awareness with truth with in myself and the increased context ability to communicate truth to others. I have really enjoyed the scent and the outcomes from the experience N Nikki P. Locked up I ordered this with sacred body and truth teller based on my flower quiz results and strong affinity to it. I ordered it right away. It arrived on a Saturday, Dec 30th. It was left in a parcel box with a key to the box in my mailbox. The key was not able to open the parcel box. I felt like this is mirroring something/divine truth locked up in my throat and I am not able to access it. I asked my family for help and they couldn't get the lock to open. I had to wait until Jan2nd to contact USPS for help and a new key. On Jan 2nd, I called USPS and after 4th try they picked up the phone. Very quickly they found out my mailman's name and said they would contact him to get me the parcel asap. phew! I had another package arriving from Lotus Wei as part of flowerevolution monthly flower and chocolate. This package came on Jan 2nd and was delivered to my garage door instead of the mailbox, before I made the call to USPS. Later in the day when I went to pick up the 2nd package by my garage door, I noticed that Divine truth package was tied to the 2nd package. Yahoo! I have never had this happen before. Such an interesting experience.  Divine truth in combination with other flower essences from here, has been helping me go deeper into my fears and blind spots to retrieve my light, true self. L Lauren S. So special! This is such a unique and special blend - I love it and have noticed significant shifts in my own ability to speak truth from the heart. Ah, so happy to hear it! If you haven't worked with them already, pairing Divine Truth with Truthteller & Sacred Awareness is a very powerful trio that we highly recommend! :) L Ludmila F. Ease and joy of speaking my truth The Divine Truth elixir amazed me with its quick effect. At the very first day my unease with speaking from my heart was so diminished that I couldn't believe myself. I've been people pleaser all my life. My throat chakra has been constricted so much that sometimes I couldn't say anything when actually I needed to say a lot. I was so much afraid that I will hurt somebody's feeling that I turned down my own voice and all the rest powerful things related to the throat chakra. As I'm getting back my ability to communicate, I guess that maybe I will get back my ability to focus energy in the throat chakra to manifest better. 1 2"

They have all brought me to this point that allowed me to intuitively choose Awakened Perception. This one is so deep. It feels like I am being returned to myself without fear of my truest self. The intuition is turned on. The love is turned on. The trust is turned on. The fear of being seen by myself and others is turned off! It's as though I can now start to see/hear through all the noise - as though there is a single voice and light guiding me. It's gentle and strong and steadfast. It's a loving and righteous warrior. I have cried a lot in the last several days. These are tears I didn't know I had. I am awake to a tenderness that I formerly judged. I am here for that. I am here for the 'me' that was long forgotten and criticized and made fun of via a history of trauma. The insight is ... well, it's like a light switch has been turned on. Awakened Perception indeed! Thank you Lotuswei. This heart has been asking for this awareness and support for so very long. Very grateful. :) Awakened, seen, supported—thank you for your beautiful words. Y Yue Awakened Perception is one of my top essences at the moment. I got it at a time when I was going through a lot of fear triggered by negative energies and situations. Having consistently used it, it really feels like a gentle peeling back of illusions, and old wounds around stepping into my power and being seen. I actually saw it was a recommended blend for the Horse in the Year of Snake chart, and it fit exactly what I was going through (and I'm a Horse). I feel it indeed works with my horse-like sensitivity, and it's been supporting me in tapping into a greater truth within, and greater expansion into the outer world. A beautiful blend. Awakened Perception was made for you!! So incredible to hear it’s guiding you to deeper truth & expansion. K Kellie Miraculous shift in perspective I'm undergoing Western medical treatment for breast cancer, with an integrative approach. At each step, I face a point of massive resistance (like chemotherapy) and your essences have been entirely helpful in shifting me into a healing mode. This week seemed insurmountable, however, as tmrw is surgery and the idea of sacrificing a breast (while life-saving) is almost too much to bear. I have Awakened Perception sitting on the shelf, having not used it, and it practically leapt into my hand the other day. I've sprayed myself since and it's been a miracle! I've left denial behind and am finally accepting my diagnosis, the mastectomy, and the knowledge that I'll walk differently in the world. I feel protected, clear, and dare I say, curious about what I will offer to others from this new me. I couldn't imagine getting here, and now I can't imagine getting here without these flower allies. xoxo Thank you for the beautiful share. Your courage and openness are truly inspiring! M Mama I'm Wearing MY Clothes! That title may sound glossy, but truly. I had been acquiring clothes that I wanted to wear for about 7 years that would express who I really was after I reached 55. Yet still, I wore my ""office invisible style"" and no one ever asked me what I could do for the business (I have TONS of Know-how & energy) nor would they listen when I tried to let them hear what I could do for the company. All the fears of being judged as ""inappropriate and non-conformist subsided. I dressed like me: smart, experienced, colorful. People started to talk with me, share, hug, tell me positive perceptions they had of me. Those are all firsts!  I am wearing the confidence in who I am comfortably, and I feel better about being where I am and who I am in this business. I stopped my habit of reviewing everyone else's fears to gauge if I could make them feel better. (Yeah, that's codependency in a work environment!) Wow, truly an incredible share! Thrilled you're embracing your true, vibrant self! J J.H. Gentle dissolution of illusion Around week 3-4 of using a LotusWei blend I often receive a dream or a vision that encapsulates the lessons of the flowers. This blend for me has dissolved so much of my fear perception about others and shown me all the love I've closed myself off to. The dream I received I would summarize as a ""sea of love."" The vision I received was that of a flower glued shut, and the glue gently being dissolved so the flower could bloom and receive love-light. I took this blend in conjunction with Sacred Heart, and I think their synergy gave rise to a beautiful soft clarity. I am ordering another bottle because I feel my heart-work has just begun. No blend has ever been too strong or too confronting; they all seem to meet me where i am and dissolve or highlight just what I need to see or feel in that moment. The flowers are here to love us and support our unfolding. Incredible description of Awakened Perception ~ that gave me goosebumps! A beautiful mirror of how the flower essences collaborate with our enegetic systems in the precise ways we need! L L.L. Truthfully you I have just started taking this elixir for the first time and I have noticed profound changes in 24 hours. A real clarity in seeing the truth, which then helps me to be more honest and authentic with myself and others - and asking for what I need. It feels like it is gently removing areas that have been “glossed over” ir avoided, and being me get to a more authentic and truthful state. I’m looking forward to noticing how I change and relate with the world over coming weeks.  Thank you! That is amazing to hear your wonderful growth and transformation with Awakened Perception! S Sarah Wonderful company and products. Just started using these so will review the magic from them later Sarah thank you so much! :) xoxo"

Orange Gelatin Dessert My favorite way to use the orange flavored soda drops, besides in seltzer, is to make home made Orange Gelatin (healthy jello). In a small saucepan, add the juice of one very ripe orange with 3 drops of the elixir, to one packet of organic unflavored gelatin. Heat gently until gelatin is dissolved. Let cool slightly and taste. Add more orange drops if needed, stir well and refrigerate. Enjoy! Thank you for sharing your creative use and idea for our Orange Herbal Soda Concentrate. We're so glad you enjoy making homemade Orange Gelatin with it. Your recipe sounds delicious and we can't wait to try it ourselves!! xoxo"

Awakened understanding This is my favorite so far of the three exlirs I bought.  I can feel the vibration of the flowers and my mind just feels so much more clearer, with more openess to my surroundings rather than playing the no one understands me story.  Love it, and love having it in my water too. So glad it brought clarity and openness—thank you! K KatieL Acceptance This elixir allowed me to better accept the turmoil of upleveling and remember it’s part of the growth process. It brought me peace. Thank you! Embracing growth with peace is truly powerful K Katie Woahn This flower essence is quick to make you feel an impact! (Key is to slow down when taking it!) There’s something that just hits me at a soul level with this one! So incredible to hear! Deep shifts happen when we truly slow down. O Olivia D. Excellent Flower Power I feel emotionally lighter since incorporating this into my routine and on a day I noticed I skipped my intake, the subdued anxious energy returned. Awakened Understanding makes me feel whole and capable of taking on daily challenges. So powerful! Love that Awakened Understanding supports your flow! C Cyndi S. AWAKENED UNDERSTANDING I love this product. The combo of this elixir feels stable with a sense of peace. I enjoy having it at my work desk to enjoy the energy of it and i use it in my practice as a Kinesiologist So wonderful to hear it has brought stability and peace to your space and practice. Thank you for sharing!! J JJ Revelatory I want to preface this by mentioning that I am at the beginning of the Venus sequence of the Gene Keys course. My first gift key is understanding and the next key in the sequence Siddhi is awakening so this hits home on many levels. This is the second time I’m taking both this tincture and the course and it has been profound to say the least. Mostly it’s helped me see through the many layers of programming allowing me to find comfort with not needing to know on the mental level and that simply tuning into my inner realms is enough to sooth the waves that often throw me off kilter. I like most of the tinctures but I can see myself returning to this one over time when I want to dive deeper. Thank you for sharing your profound journey! M Melanie Quite noticeable change As I’ve been taking this, I’ve noticed how my hyper vigilance has slowed to a focus group of feelings and questions where I have the space and clarity to dissect what I’m feeling as well what’s going on around me in a way that’s gently defining and truly clarifying.  Along with this I’ve been using the mist of Awakened Perception, Sacred Body, and Fierce Compassion. I feel a gentle cocoon during this awakening. Thank you. 🙏🪷🕊 Thank you for sharing! I'm so glad to hear that you're experiencing such clarity and focus during this time! K Kelly S. Uncertain I've only been using this elixir for less than a month but have had to step back from it twice now when intense irritability and too much awareness of how others are mistreating me has led to some interpersonal issues. I thought maybe the stuff that arose the first time around could've been due to some other factor, so I tried slowly reintroducing this elixir back into my routine recently when I was feeling more stable, only to have some big issues with the people around me crop up again. Not sure if there is wisdom to be gleaned here or if I'm just getting borderline irrationally oversensitive to perceived unfairness... At any rate I need to pause my use of this elixir again before I cut certain people out of my life permanently (like I've been strongly compelled to under this elixir, though I'm reluctant to do so since my life would be easier if I could work with them somehow or at least find a way for us to mutually respect one another while maintaining firm boundaries). Still on the fence about this one. If there's a light of awakened understanding at the end of this uncomfortable tunnel, I'm not quite perceiving it yet... Flower elixirs can sometimes bring up intense emotions or patterns we weren't aware of, especially when targeting deep-seated issues. This can lead to a 'healing crisis,' where the very obstacles we need to clear are highlighted. Though challenging, this process helps clear what no longer serves us. Pairing the elixir with something stabilizing, like Infinite Love, can help ground the experience, especially with more complex blends. If the elixir stirs up feelings around boundaries or relationships, it’s important to pause and reflect. If you choose to revisit it later, you may find greater clarity. We're here to support you! S Susan Subtle Awakened Understanding is subtle but I am feeling a shift in awareness about how I avoided things due to people's judgement. It is eye opening to see how much I avoid new experiences because of fear of judgement.  Still working on being free of people's judgement, but I think it's working. Amazing Susan! Grateful for your share! xo E E.B. Awakened Understanding indeed... This elixir has been in the heavy rotation for the last few weeks since receiving it. Unclouds my vision and opens my heart. Gets me to go outside and walk in the trees. I love this formula. Amazing! Thank you for sharing your wonderful feedback :) 1 2"
